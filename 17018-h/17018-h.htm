<h3>THE &quot;LUSITANIA&quot;&mdash;AND AFTER</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The news of the <i>Lusitania</i> was received at the American
Embassy at four o'clock on the afternoon of
May 7, 1915. At that time preparations were under way
for a dinner in honour of Colonel and Mrs. House; the
first <i>Lusitania</i> announcement declared that only the ship
itself had been destroyed and that all the passengers and
members of the crew had been saved; there was, therefore,
no good reason for abandoning this dinner.</p>

<p>At about seven o'clock, the Ambassador came home;
his manner showed that something extraordinary had
taken place; there were no outward signs of emotion, but
he was very serious. The first news, he now informed
Mrs. Page, had been a mistake; more than one thousand
men, women, and children had lost their lives, and more
than one hundred of these were American citizens. It was
too late to postpone the dinner but that affair was one of
the most tragic in the social history of London. The
Ambassador was constantly receiving bulletins from his
Chancery, and these, as quickly as they were received, he
read to his guests. His voice was quiet and subdued;
there were no indications of excitement in his manner or
in that of his friends, and hardly of suppressed emotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-2" id="page2-2"></a>[pg II-2]</span>
The atmosphere was rather that of dumb stupefaction.
The news seemed to have dulled everyone's capacity for
thought and even for feeling. If any one spoke, it was in
whispers. Afterward, in the drawing room, this same mental
state was the prevailing one; there was little denunciation
of Germany and practically no discussion as to the
consequences of the crime; everyone's thought was engrossed
by the harrowing and unbelievable facts which
the Ambassador was reading from the little yellow slips
that were periodically brought in. An irresistible fascination
evidently kept everybody in the room; the guests
stayed late, eager for every new item. When they
finally left, one after another, their manner was still abstracted
and they said their good-nights in low voices.
There were two reasons for this behaviour. The first was
that the Ambassador and his guests had received the details
of the greatest infamy which any supposedly civilized
state had perpetrated since the massacre of Saint Bartholomew.
The second was the conviction that the United
States would at once declare war on Germany.</p>

<p>On this latter point several of the guests expressed their
ideas and one of the most shocked and outspoken was
Colonel House. For a month the President's personal
representative had been discussing with British statesmen
possible openings for mediation, but all his hopes in this
direction now vanished. That President Wilson would
act with the utmost energy Colonel House took for
granted. This act, he evidently believed, left the United
States no option. &quot;We shall be at war with Germany
within a month,&quot; he declared.</p>

<p>The feeling that prevailed in the Embassy this evening
was the one that existed everywhere in London for several
days. Emotionally the event acted like an an&aelig;sthetic.
This was certainly the condition of all Americans associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-3" id="page2-3"></a>[pg II-3]</span>
with the American Embassy, especially Page himself.
A day or two after the sinking the Ambassador
went to Euston Station, at an early hour in the morning,
to receive the American survivors. The hundred or more
men and women who shambled from the train made a listless
and bedraggled gathering. Their grotesque clothes,
torn and unkempt&mdash;for practically none had had the opportunity
of obtaining a change of dress&mdash;their expressionless
faces, their lustreless eyes, their uncertain and
bewildered walk, faintly reflected an experience such as
comes to few people in this world. The most noticeable
thing about these unfortunates was their lack of interest
in their surroundings; everything had apparently been
reduced to a blank; the fact that practically none made
any reference to their ordeal, or could be induced to discuss
it, was a matter of common talk in London. And
something of this disposition now became noticeable in
Page himself. He wrote his dispatches to Washington
in an abstracted mood; he went through his duties almost
with the detachment of a sleep-walker; like the <i>Lusitania</i>
survivors, he could not talk much at that time about the
scenes that had taken place off the coast of Ireland. Yet
there were many indications that he was thinking about
them, and his thoughts, as his letters reveal, were concerned
with more things than the tragedy itself. He
believed that his country was now face to face with its
destiny. What would Washington do?</p>

<p>Page had a characteristic way of thinking out his problems.
He performed his routine work at the Chancery
in the daytime, but his really serious thinking he did in
his own room at night. The picture is still a vivid one
in the recollection of his family and his other intimates.
Even at this time Page's health was not good, yet he frequently
spent the evening at his office in Grosvenor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-4" id="page2-4"></a>[pg II-4]</span>
Gardens, and when the long day's labours were finished,
he would walk rather wearily to his home at No. 6 Grosvenor
Square. He would enter the house slowly&mdash;and his
walk became slower and more tired as the months went
by&mdash;go up to his room and cross to the fireplace, so apparently
wrapped up in his own thoughts that he hardly
greeted members of his own family. A wood fire was kept
burning for him, winter and summer alike; Page would
put on his dressing gown, drop into a friendly chair, and
sit there, doing nothing, reading nothing, saying nothing&mdash;only
thinking. Sometimes he would stay for an hour;
not infrequently he would remain till two, three, or four
o'clock in the morning; occasions were not unknown when
his almost motionless figure would be in this same place
at daybreak. He never slept through these nights, and
he never even dozed; he was wide awake, and his mind was
silently working upon the particular problem that was
uppermost in his thoughts. He never rose until he had
solved it or at least until he had decided upon a course of
action. He would then get up abruptly, go to bed, and
sleep like a child. The one thing that made it possible
for a man of his delicate frame, racked as it was by anxiety
and over work, to keep steadily at his task, was the
wonderful gift which he possessed of sleeping.</p>

<p>Page had thought out many problems in this way. The
tension caused by the sailing of the <i>Dacia</i>, in January,
1915, and the deftness with which the issue had been
avoided by substituting a French for a British cruiser,
has already been described. Page discovered this solution
on one of these all-night self-communings. It was
almost two o'clock in the morning that he rose, said to
himself, &quot;I've got it!&quot; and then went contentedly to bed.
And during the anxious months that followed the <i>Lusitania</i>,
the <i>Arabic</i>, and those other outrages which have now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-5" id="page2-5"></a>[pg II-5]</span>
taken their place in history, he spent night after night
turning the matter over in his mind. But he found no
way out of the humiliations presented by the policy of
Washington.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we are swung loose in time,&quot; he wrote to his son
Arthur, a few days after the first <i>Lusitania</i> note had been
sent to Germany, &quot;nobody knows the day or the week or
the month or the year&mdash;and we are caught on this island,
with no chance of escape, while the vast slaughter goes on
and seems just beginning, and the degradation of war
goes on week by week; and we live in hope that the United
States will come in, as the only chance to give us standing
and influence when the reorganization of the world must
begin. (Beware of betraying the word 'hope'!) It has
all passed far beyond anybody's power to describe. I
simply go on day by day into unknown experiences and
emotions, seeing nothing before me very clearly and remembering
only dimly what lies behind. I can see only
one proper thing: that all the world should fall to and hunt
this wild beast down.</p>

<p>&quot;Two photographs of little Mollie<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" /><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on my mantelpiece
recall persons and scenes and hopes unconnected with the
war: few other things can. Bless the baby, she couldn't
guess what a sweet purpose she serves.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The sensations of most Americans in London during
this crisis are almost indescribable. Washington's failure
promptly to meet the situation affected them with astonishment
and humiliation. Colonel House was confident
that war was impending, and for this reason he hurried
his preparations to leave England; he wished to be in the
United States, at the President's side, when the declaration
was made. With this feeling about Mr. Wilson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-6" id="page2-6"></a>[pg II-6]</span>
Colonel House received a fearful shock a day or two after
the <i>Lusitania</i> had gone down: while walking in Piccadilly,
he caught a glimpse of one of the famous sandwich men,
bearing a poster of an afternoon newspaper. This glaring
broadside bore the following legend: &quot;We are too proud
to fight&mdash;Woodrow Wilson.&quot; The sight of that placard
was Colonel House's first intimation that the President
might not act vigorously. He made no attempt to conceal
from Page and other important men at the American Embassy
the shock which it had given him. Soon the whole
of England was ringing with these six words; the newspapers
were filled with stinging editorials and cartoons,
and the music halls found in the Wilsonian phrase materials
for their choicest jibes. Even in more serious quarters
America was the subject of the most severe denunciation.
No one felt these strictures more poignantly than President
Wilson's closest confidant. A day or two before sailing
home he came into the Embassy greatly depressed at
the prevailing revulsion against the United States. &quot;I
feel,&quot; Colonel House said to Page, &quot;as though I had been
given a kick at every lamp post coming down Constitution
Hill.&quot; A day or two afterward Colonel House sailed for
America.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>And now came the period of distress and of disillusionment.
Three <i>Lusitania</i> notes were sent and were evasively
answered, and Washington still seemed to be marking
time. The one event in this exciting period which
gave Page satisfaction was Mr. Bryan's resignation as
Secretary of State. For Mr. Bryan personally Page had a
certain fondness, but as head of the State Department the
Nebraska orator had been a cause of endless vexation.
Many of Page's letters, already printed, bear evidence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-7" id="page2-7"></a>[pg II-7]</span>
the utter demoralization which existed in this branch of
the Administration and this demoralization became especially
glaring during the <i>Lusitania</i> crisis. No attempt
was made even at this momentous period to keep the London
Embassy informed as to what was taking place in
Washington; Page's letters and cablegrams were, for the
most part, unacknowledged and unanswered, and the
American Ambassador was frequently obliged to obtain
his information about the state of feeling in Washington
from Sir Edward Grey. It must be said, in justice to Mr.
Bryan, that this carelessness was nothing particularly new,
for it had worried many ambassadors before Page. Readers
of Charles Francis Adams's correspondence meet with the
same complaints during the Civil War; even at the time
of the <i>Trent</i> crisis, when for a fortnight Great Britain and
the United States were living on the brink of war, Adams
was kept entirely in the dark about the plans of
Washington<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" /><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The letters of John Hay show a similar
condition during his brief ambassadorship to Great Britain
in 1897-1898<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" /><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bryan's incumbency was guilty of diplomatic
vices which were peculiarly its own. The &quot;leaks&quot; in the
State Department, to which Page has already referred,
were constantly taking place; the Ambassador would send
the most confidential cipher dispatches to his superior,
cautioning the Department that they must be held inviolably
secret, and then he would pick up the London
newspapers the next morning and find that everything
had been cabled from Washington. To most readers, the
informal method of conducting foreign business, as it is
disclosed in these letters, probably comes as something of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-8" id="page2-8"></a>[pg II-8]</span>
a shock. Page is here discovered discussing state matters,
not in correspondence with the Secretary of State,
but in private unofficial communications to the President,
and especially to Colonel House&mdash;the latter at that
time not an official person at all. All this, of course,
was extremely irregular and, in any properly organized
State Department, it would have been even reprehensible.
But the point is that there was no properly organized
State Department at that time, and the impossibility of
conducting business through the regular channels compelled
Page to adopt other means. &quot;There is only one
way to reform the State Department,&quot; he informed Colonel
House at this time. &quot;That is to raze the whole building,
with its archives and papers, to the ground, and begin
all over again.&quot;</p>

<p>This state of affairs in Washington explains the curious
fact that the real diplomatic history of the United States
and Great Britain during this great crisis is not to be found
in the archives of the State Department, for the official
documents on file there consist of the most routine telegrams,
which are not particularly informing, but in the
Ambassador's personal correspondence with the President,
Colonel House, and a few other intimates. The State
Department did not have the first requisite of a properly
organized foreign office, for it could not be trusted with
confidential information. The Department did not tell
Page what it was doing, but it apparently told the whole
world what Page was doing. It is an astonishing fact that
Page could not write and cable the most important details,
for he was afraid that they would promptly be given
to the reporters.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;I shall not send another confidential message to the
State Department,&quot; Page wrote to Colonel House,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-9" id="page2-9"></a>[pg II-9]</span>
September 15, 1914; &quot;it's too dangerous. Time and time
again now the Department has leaked. Last week, I
sent a dispatch and I said in the body of it, '<i>this is confidential
and under no condition to be given out or made public,
but to be regarded as inviolably secret</i>.' The very next
morning it was telegraphed from Washington to the London
newspapers. Bryan telegraphed me that he was sure it
didn't get out from the Department and that he now had
so fixed it that there could be no leak. He's said that at
least four times before. The Department swarms with
newspaper men, I hear. But whether it does or not the
leak continues. I have to go with my tail between my
legs and apologize to Sir Edward Grey and to do myself that
shame and to do my very best to keep his confidence&mdash;against
these unnecessary odds. The only way to be safe
is to do the job perfunctorily, to answer the questions the
Department sends and to do nothing on your own account.
That's the reason so many of our men do their
jobs in that way&mdash;or <i>one</i> reason and a strong one. We can
never have an alert and energetic and powerful service
until men can trust the Department and until they can
get necessary information from it. I wrote the President
that of course I'd go on till the war ended and all the questions
growing out of it were settled, and that then he must
excuse me, if I must continue to be exposed to this danger
and humiliation. In the meantime, I shall send all my
confidential matter in private letters to him.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Page did not regard Mr. Bryan's opinions and attitudes
as a joke: to him they were a serious matter and, in his
eyes, Bryan was most interesting as a national menace.
He regarded the Secretary as the extreme expression of
an irrational sentimentalism that was in danger of undermining
the American character, especially as the kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-10" id="page2-10"></a>[pg II-10]</span>
thought he represented was manifest in many phases of
American life. In a moment of exasperation, Page gave
expression to this feeling in a letter to his son:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Arthur W. Page</i><br />
<br />
London, June 6, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>... We're in danger of being feminized and fad-ridden&mdash;grape
juice (God knows water's good enough:
why grape juice?); pensions; Christian Science; peace
cranks; efficiency-correspondence schools; aid-your-memory;
women's clubs; co-this and co-t'other and coddling
in general; Billy Sunday; petticoats where breeches
ought to be and breeches where petticoats ought to be;
white livers and soft heads and milk-and-water;&mdash;I don't
want war: nobody knows its horrors or its degradations or
its cost. But to get rid of hyphenated degenerates perhaps
it's worth while, and to free us from 'isms and soft
folk. That's the domestic view of it. As for being
kicked by a sauerkraut caste&mdash;O Lord, give us backbone!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Heartily yours,<br />
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<p>In the bottom of this note, Page has cut a notch in the
paper and against it he has written: &quot;This notch is the
place to apply a match to this letter.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;Again and ever I am reminded,&quot; Page also wrote in
reference to Bryan's resignation, &quot;of the danger of having
to do with cranks. A certain orderliness of mind and
conduct seems essential for safety in this short life.
Spiritualists, bone-rubbers, anti-vivisectionists, all sort
of anti's in fact, those who have fads about education or
fads against it, Perfectionists, Daughters of the Dove of
Peace, Sons of the Roaring Torrent, itinerant peace-mongers&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-11" id="page2-11"></a>[pg II-11]</span>
these may have a real genius among them
once in forty years; but to look for an exception to the
common run of yellow dogs and damfools among them is
like opening oysters with the hope of finding pearls. It's
the common man we want and the uncommon common
man when we can find him&mdash;never the crank. This is
the lesson of Bryan.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At one time, however, Mr. Bryan's departure seemed
likely to have important consequences for Page. Colonel
House and others strongly urged the President to call him
home from London and make him Secretary of State.
This was the third position in President Wilson's Cabinet
for which Page had been considered. The early plans
to make him Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of
Agriculture have already been described. Of all cabinet
posts, however, the one that would have especially attracted
him would have been the Department of State.
But President Wilson believed that the appointment of an
Ambassador at one of the belligerent capitals, especially
of an Ambassador whose sympathies for the Allies were
so pronounced as were Page's, would have been an &quot;un-neutral&quot;
act, and, therefore, Colonel House's recommendation
was not approved.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR PAGE:</p>

<p>The President finally decided to appoint Lansing to
succeed Mr. Bryan. In my opinion, he did wisely, though
I would have preferred his appointing you.</p>

<p>The argument against your appointment was the fact
that you are an Ambassador at one of the belligerent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-12" id="page2-12"></a>[pg II-12]</span>
capitals. The President did not think it would do, and
from what I read, when your name was suggested I take
it there would have been much criticism. I am sorry&mdash;sorrier
than I can tell you, for it would have worked admirably
in the general scheme of things.</p>

<p>However, I feel sure that Lansing will do the job, and
that you will find your relations with him in every way
satisfactory.</p>

<p>The President spent yesterday with me and we talked
much of you. He is looking well and feeling so.
I read the President your letter and he enjoyed it as
much as I did.</p>

<p>I am writing hastily, for I am leaving for Manchester,
Massachusetts, where I shall be during July and August.</p></div>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>But, in addition to the <i>Lusitania</i> crisis, a new terror now
loomed on the horizon. Page's correspondence reveals
that Bryan had more reasons than one for his resignation;
he was now planning to undertake a self-appointed mission
to Europe for the purpose of opening peace negotiations
entirely on his own account.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>From Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
Manchester, Massachusetts,<br />
August 12th, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR PAGE:</p>

<p>The Bryans have been stopping with the X's. X
writes me that Bryan told him that he intended to go to
Europe soon and try peace negotiations. He has Lloyd
George in mind in England, and it is then his purpose to
go to Germany.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-13" id="page2-13"></a>[pg II-13]</span>
<p>I take it he will want credentials from the President
which, of course, he will not want to give, but just what
he will feel obliged to give is another story. I anticipated
this when he resigned. I knew it was merely a matter of
time when he would take this step.</p>

<p>He may find encouragement in Germany, for he is in
high favour now in that quarter. It is his purpose to
oppose the President upon the matter of &quot;preparedness,&quot;
and, from what we can learn, it will not be long before
there will be open antagonism between the Administration
and himself.</p>

<p>It might be a good thing to encourage his going to
Europe. He would probably come back a sadder and
wiser man. I take it that no one in authority in England
would discuss the matter seriously with him, and, in
France, I do not believe he could even get a hearing.</p>

<p>Please let me have your impressions upon this subject.</p>

<p>I wish I could be near you to-day for there are so many
things I could tell that I cannot write.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Your friend,<br />
E.M. House.<br />
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
American Embassy, London [Undated].<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>Never mind about Bryan. Send him over here if you
wish to get rid of him. He'll cut no more figure than a
tar-baby at a Negro camp-meeting. If he had come while
he was Secretary, I should have jumped off London
Bridge and the country would have had one ambassador
less. But I shall enjoy him now. You see some peace
crank from the United States comes along every week&mdash;some
crank or some gang of cranks. There've been two
this week. Ever since the Daughters of the Dove of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-14" id="page2-14"></a>[pg II-14]</span>
Peace met at The Hague, the game has become popular
in America; and I haven't yet heard that a single one has
been shot&mdash;so far. I think that some of them are likely
soon to be hanged, however, because there are signs that
they may come also from Germany. The same crowd
that supplies money to buy labour-leaders and the press
and to blow up factories in the United States keeps a good
supply of peace-liars on tap. It'll be fun to watch Bryan
perform and never suspect that anybody is lying to him
or laughing at him; and he'll go home convinced that he's
done the job and he'll let loose doves all over the land till
they are as thick as English sparrows. Not even the
President could teach him anything permanently. He
can do no harm on this side the world. It's only your
side that's in any possible danger; and, if I read the signs
right, there's a diminishing danger there.</p>

<p>No, there's never yet come a moment when there was
the slightest chance of peace. Did the Emperor not say
last year that peace would come in October, and again
this year in October? Since he said it, how can it come?</p>

<p>The ambitions and the actions of men, my friend, are
determined by their antecedents, their surroundings, and
their opportunities&mdash;the great deeds of men before them
whom consciously or unconsciously they take for models,
the codes they are reared by, and the chances that they
think they see. These influences shaped Alexander and
C&aelig;sar, and they shaped you and me. Now every monarch
on the Continent has behind him the Napoleonic
example. &quot;Can I do that?&quot; crosses the mind of every one.
Of course every one thinks of himself as doing it beneficently&mdash;for
the good of the world. Napoleon, himself,
persuaded himself of his benevolent intentions, and the
devil of it was he persuaded other people also. Now the
only monarch in Europe in our time who thought he had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-15" id="page2-15"></a>[pg II-15]</span>
chance is your friend in Berlin. When he told you last
year (1914) that of course he didn't want war, but that he
was &quot;ready,&quot; that's what he meant. A similar ambition,
of course, comes into the mind of every professional
soldier of the continent who rises to eminence. In Berlin
you have both&mdash;the absolute monarch and the military
class of ambitious soldiers and their fighting machine.
Behind these men walks the Napoleonic ambition all the
time, just as in the United States we lie down every night
in George Washington's feather-bed of no entangling
alliances.</p>

<p>Then remember, too, that the German monarchy is a
cross between the Napoleonic ambition and its inheritance
from Frederick the Great and Bismarck. I suppose the
three damnedest liars that were ever born are these
three&mdash;old Frederick, Napoleon, and Bismarck&mdash;not, I
take it, because they naturally loved lying, but because
the game they played constantly called for lying. There
was no other way to play it: they <i>had</i> to fool people all the
time. You have abundant leisure&mdash;do this: Read the
whole career of Napoleon and write down the startling
and exact parallels that you will find there to what is
happening to-day. The French were united and patriotic,
just as the Germans now are. When they invaded other
people's territory, they said they were attacked and that
the other people had brought on war. They had their
lying diplomats, their corruption funds; they levied money
on cities and states; they took booty; and they were God's
elect. It's a wonderful parallel&mdash;not strangely, because
the game is the same and the moral methods are the same.
Only the tools are somewhat different&mdash;the submarine, for
example. Hence the <i>Lusitania</i> disaster (not disavowed,
you will observe), the <i>Arabic</i> disaster, the propaganda,
underground and above, in the United States. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-16" id="page2-16"></a>[pg II-16]</span>
there'll be more. The Napoleonic Wars were about eleven
years long. I fancy that we shall have war and wars
from this attempt to dominate Europe, for perhaps as
long a period. The Balkans can't be quieted by this war
only, nor Russia and Italy perhaps. And Germany may
have a series of earthquakes herself&mdash;internal explosions.
Then Poland and perhaps some of the Scandinavian
States. Nobody can tell.</p>

<p>I cannot express my admiration of the President's
management, so far at least, of his colossal task of leading
us right. He has shown his supreme wisdom up to this
point and I have the profoundest confidence in his judgment.
But I hope he doesn't fool himself about the future;
I'm sure he doesn't. I see no possible way for us to
keep out, because I know the ignorance and falseness of
the German leaders. They'll drown or kill more Americans&mdash;on
the sea and in America. They <i>may</i> at last even
attack one of our own passenger ships, or do something
that will dramatically reveal them to the whole American
people. Then, of course, the tune will be called. It's
only a question of time; and I am afraid the war will last
long enough to give them time. An early peace is all that
can prevent them from driving us at last into war; and I
can see no chance of an early peace. You had as well prepare
as fast as the condition of public opinion will permit.</p>

<p>There could be no better measure of the immeasurable
moral advance that the United States has made over
Europe than the incredulity of our people. They simply
can't comprehend what the Napoleonic legend can do,
nor the low political morality of the Continent&mdash;of Berlin
in particular. Hence they don't believe it. We have
gone on for 100 years working might and main to better
our condition and the condition of people about us&mdash;the
greatest effort made by the largest number of people since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-17" id="page2-17"></a>[pg II-17]</span>
the world began to further the mood and the arts of peace.
There is no other such chapter in human history as our
work for a hundred years. Yet just a hundred years ago
the Capitol at Washington was burned by&mdash;a political
oligarchy in the freest country of Europe&mdash;as damnable
an atrocity as you will find in history. The Germans
are a hundred years behind the English in political development
and political morality.</p>

<p>So, let Willum J. come. He can't hurt Europe&mdash;nor
help it; and you can spare him. Let all the Peace-gang
come. You can spare <i>them</i>, too; and they can do no harm
here. Let somebody induce Hoke Smith to come, too.
You have hit on a great scheme&mdash;friendly deportation.</p>

<p>And Bryan won't be alone. Daughters of the Dove of
Peace and Sons of the Olive Branch come every week.
The latest Son came to see me to-day. He said that the
German Chancellor told him that he wanted peace&mdash;wants
it now and wants it bad, and that only one thing
stood in the way&mdash;if England would agree not to take
Belgium, Germany would at once make peace! This
otherwise sensible American wanted me to take him to see
Sir Edward to tell him this, and to suggest to him to go
over to Holland next week to meet the German Chancellor
and fix it up. A few days ago a pious preacher chap
(American) who had come over to &quot;fix it all up,&quot; came
back from France and called on me. He had seen something
in France&mdash;he was excited and he didn't quite make
it clear what he had seen; but he said that if they'd only
let him go home safely and quickly he'd promise not to
mention peace any more&mdash;did I think the American boats
<i>entirely</i> safe?&mdash;So, you see, I do have some fun even in
these dark days.</p></div>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>This letter discloses that Page was pinning his faith in
President Wilson, and that he still had confidence in the
President's determination to uphold the national honour.
Page was not one of those who thought that the United
States should declare war immediately after the <i>Lusitania</i>.
The President's course, in giving Germany a chance to
make amends, and to disavow the act, met with his approval,
and he found, also, much to admire in Mr. Wilson's
first <i>Lusitania</i> note. His judgment in this matter was
based first of all upon the merits of the case; besides this,
his admiration for Mr. Wilson as a public man was strong.
To think otherwise of the President would have been a
great grief to the Ambassador and to differ with his
chief on the tremendous issue of the war would have
meant for Page the severance of one of the most cherished
associations of his life. The interest which he had shown
in advocating Wilson's presidential candidacy has already
been set forth; and many phases of the Wilson administration
had aroused his admiration. The President's
handling of domestic problems Page regarded as a masterpiece
in reconciling statesmanship with practical politics,
and his energetic attitude on the Panama Tolls had introduced
new standards into American foreign relations.
Page could not sympathize with all the details of the Wilsonian
Mexican policy, yet he saw in it a high-minded
purpose and a genuine humanitarianism. But the outbreak
of war presented new aspects of Mr. Wilson's mind.
The President's attitude toward the European struggle,
his conception of &quot;neutrality,&quot; and his failure to grasp
the meaning of the conflict, seemed to Page to show a lack
of fundamental statesmanship; still his faith in Wilson
was deep-seated, and he did not abandon hope that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-19" id="page2-19"></a>[pg II-19]</span>
President could be brought to see things as they really
were. Page even believed that he might be instrumental
in his conversion.</p>

<p>But in the summer and autumn of 1915 one agony
followed another. The &quot;too proud to fight&quot; speech was
in Page's mind nothing less than a tragedy. The president's
first <i>Lusitania</i> note for a time restored the Ambassador's
confidence; it seemed to show that the President
intended to hold Germany to that &quot;strict accountability&quot;
which he had threatened. But Mr. Wilson's course now
presented new difficulties to his Ambassador. Still Page
believed that the President, in his own way and in
his own time, would find a path out of his dilemma
that would protect the honour and the safety of the
United States. If any of the Embassy subordinates
became impatient over the procedure of Washington, he
did not find a sympathetic listener in the Ambassador.
The whole of London and of Europe might be resounding
with denunciations of the White House, but Page would
tolerate no manifestations of hostility in his presence.
&quot;The problem appears different to Washington than it
does to us,&quot; he would say to his confidants. &quot;We see
only one side of it; the President sees all sides. If we give
him all the facts, he will decide the thing wisely.&quot; Englishmen
with whom the Ambassador came into contact
soon learned that they could not become flippant or critical
about Mr. Wilson in his presence; he would resent
the slightest hostile remark, and he had a way of phrasing
his rebukes that usually discouraged a second attempt.
About this time Page began to keep closely to himself,
and to decline invitations to dinners and to country houses,
even those with which he was most friendly. The reason
was that he could not meet Englishmen and Englishwomen,
or even Americans who were resident in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-20" id="page2-20"></a>[pg II-20]</span>
on his old easy familiar terms; he knew the ideas which
everybody entertained about his country, and he knew
also what they were saying, when he was not among them;
the restraint which his presence necessarily put upon his
friends produced an uncongenial atmosphere, and the
Ambassador therefore gave up, for a time, those distractions
which had ordinarily proved such a delightful
relief from his duties. For the first time since he had come
to England he found himself a solitary man. He even
refused to attend the American Luncheon Club in London
because, in speeches and in conversation, the members
did not hesitate to assail the Wilson policies.</p>

<p>Events, however, eventually proved too strong for the
most devoted supporter of President Wilson. After the
<i>Arabic</i> and the <i>Hesperian</i>, Page's official intimates saw
signs that the Ambassador was losing confidence in his old
friend. He would discuss Mr. Wilson occasionally, with
those secretaries, such as Mr. Laughlin, in whom his confidence
was strongest; his expressions, however, were never
flippant or violent. That Page could be biting as well as
brilliant in his comments on public personages his letters
abundantly reveal, yet he never exercised his talent
for sarcasm or invective at the expense of the White
House. He never forgot that Mr. Wilson was President
and that he was Ambassador; he would still defend
the Administration; and he even now continued to
find consolation in the reflection that Mr. Wilson was
living in a different atmosphere and that he had difficulties
to confront of which a man in London could know
nothing. The Ambassador's emotion was rather one of
disappointment and sorrow, mingled with anxiety as to
the plight into which his country was being led. As to
his duty in this situation, however, Page never hesitated.
In his relations with his Embassy and with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-21" id="page2-21"></a>[pg II-21]</span>
British world he maintained this non-critical attitude; but
in his letters to President Wilson and Colonel House,
he was describing the situation, and expressing his convictions,
with the utmost freedom and frankness. In
both these attitudes Page was consistent and absolutely
loyal. It was his duty to carry out the Wilson instructions
and he had too high a conception of the Ambassadorial
office to show to the world any unfavourable opinions
he may have held about his country's course. His
duty to his post made it just as imperative that he set
forth to the President the facts exactly as they were.
And this the Ambassador now proceeded to do. For the
mere ornamental dignities of an Ambassadorship Page
cared nothing; he was wasting his health in his duties and
exhausting his private resources; much as he loved the
English and congenial as were his surroundings, the fear
of being recalled for &quot;disloyalty&quot; or insubordination
never influenced him. The letters which he now wrote
to Colonel House and to President Wilson himself are
probably without parallel in the diplomatic annals of this
or of any other country. In them he told the President
precisely what Englishmen thought of him and of the extent
to which the United States was suffering in European
estimation from the Wilson policy. His boldness sometimes
astounded his associates. One day a friend and
adviser of President Wilson's came into the Ambassador's
office just as Page had finished one of his communications
to Washington.</p>

<p>&quot;Read that!&quot; the Ambassador said, handing over the
manuscript to his visitor.</p>

<p>As the caller read, his countenance displayed the progressive
stages of his amazement. When he had finished,
his hands dropped helplessly upon his knees.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that the way you write to the President?&quot; he gasped.</p>

<div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-22" id="page2-22"></a>[pg II-22]</span>
</div>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Page replied, quietly. &quot;Why not? Why
shouldn't I tell him the truth? That is what I am here
for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no other person in the world who dare talk to
him like that!&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p>This is unquestionably the fact. That President Wilson
did not like people about him whose views were opposed
to his own is now no secret, and during the period when his
policy was one of the great issues of the world there was
probably no one except Page who intruded upon his solitude
with ideas that so abruptly disagreed with the opinions of
the White House. The letters which Page wrote Colonel
House were intended, of course, for the President himself,
and practically all of them Colonel House read
aloud to the head of the nation. The two men would
closet themselves in the old cabinet room on the second
floor of the White House&mdash;that same room in which Lincoln
had met his advisers during Civil War days; and here
Colonel House would quietly read the letters in which Page
so mercilessly portrayed the situation as it appeared in
English and European eyes. The President listened impassively,
giving no sign of approval or disapproval, and
hardly, at times, of much interest. In the earlier days,
when Page's letters consisted of pictures of English life
and English men, and colourful descriptions of England
under the stress of war, the President was vastly entertained;
he would laugh loudly at Page's wit, express his
delight at his graphic and pungent style and feel deeply
the horrors of war as his Ambassador unfolded them. &quot;I
always found Page compelling on paper,&quot; Mr. Wilson remarked
to Mr. Laughlin, during one of the latter's visits
to Washington. &quot;I could never resist him&mdash;I get more
information from his letters than from any other single
source. Tell him to keep it up.&quot; It was during this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-23" id="page2-23"></a>[pg II-23]</span>
period that the President used occasionally to read Page's
letters to the Cabinet, expressing his great appreciation of
their charm and historical importance. &quot;The President
quoted from one of the Ambassador's letters to the Cabinet
to-day,&quot; a member of the Cabinet wrote to Mrs.
Page in February, 1915. &quot;'Some day,' the President
said, 'I hope that Walter Page's letters will be published.
They are the best letters I have ever read. They make
you feel the atmosphere in England, understand the people,
and see into the motives of the great actors.'&quot; The
President repeated this statement many times, and his
letters to Page show how greatly he enjoyed and profited
from this correspondence. But after the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i> and the <i>Arabic</i> his attitude toward Page and his
letters changed.</p>

<p>He now found little pleasure or satisfaction in the Page
communications. When Mr. Wilson found that one of his
former confidants had turned out to be a critic, that man
instantaneously passed out of his life. And this was now
Page's fate; the friendship and associations of forty years
were as though they had never been. Just why Mr.
Wilson did not recall his Ambassador is a question that
has puzzled Page's friends. He would sometimes refer
to him as a man who was &quot;more British than the British,&quot;
as one who had been taken completely captive by British
blandishments, but he never came to the point of dismissing
him. Perhaps he did not care to face the public
scandal that such an act would have caused; but a more
plausible reason is that Page, despite the causes which he
had given for irritation, was indispensable to him. Page's
early letters had furnished the President ideas which had
taken shape in Wilson's policies, and, disagreeable as the
communications now became, there are evidences that
they influenced the solitary statesman in the White House,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-24" id="page2-24"></a>[pg II-24]</span>
and that they had much to do in finally forcing Mr. Wilson
into the war. The alternative question, as to why
Page did not retire when he found himself so out of sympathy
with the President, will be sufficiently answered in
subsequent chapters; at present it may be said that he did
resign and only consented to remain at the urgent request
of Washington. In fact, all during 1915 and 1916, there
seemed to be a fear in Washington that Page would definitely
abandon the London post. On one occasion, when the
newspapers published rumours to this effect, Page received
an urgent despatch from Mr. Lansing. The message
came at a time&mdash;the date was October 26, 1915&mdash;when
Page was especially discouraged over the Washington
policy. &quot;Representatives of the press,&quot; said Mr. Lansing,
&quot;have repeated rumours that you are planning to resign.
These have been brought to the President's attention,
and both he and I have denied them. Still these rumours
persist, and they cause both the President and me great
anxiety. We cannot believe that they are well founded.</p>

<p>&quot;In view of the fact that they are so persistent, we have
thought it well to inform you of them and to tell you how
earnestly we hope that they are baseless. We trust that
you will set both our minds at rest.&quot;</p>

<p>If Page had ever had any compunction about addressing
the President in blunt phrases these expressions certainly
convinced him that he was a free agent.</p>

<p>Yet Page himself at times had his doubts as to the value
of this correspondence. He would frequently discuss the
matter with Mr. Laughlin. &quot;That's a pretty harsh letter,&quot;
he would say. &quot;I don't like to talk that way to the
President, yet it doesn't express half what I feel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's your duty to tell the President the real state of
affairs,&quot; Mr. Laughlin would urge.</p>

<p>&quot;But do you suppose it does any good?&quot; Page would ask.</p>

<div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-25" id="page2-25"></a>[pg II-25]</span>
</div>
<p>&quot;Yes, it's bound to, and whether it does or not, it's
your business to keep him informed.&quot;</p>

<p>If in these letters Page seems to lay great stress on the
judgment of Great Britain and Europe on American
policy, it must be remembered that that was his particular
province. One of an Ambassador's most important duties
is to transmit to his country the public opinion of the
country to which he is accredited. It was Page's place to
tell Washington what Great Britain thought of it; it was
Washington's business to formulate policy, after giving
due consideration to this and other matters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>I enclose a pamphlet in ridicule of the President. I
don't know who wrote it, for my inquiries so far have
brought no real information. I don't feel like sending it
to him. I send it to you&mdash;to do with as you think best.
This thing alone is, of course, of no consequence. But it
is symptomatic. There is much feeling about the slowness
with which he acts. One hundred and twenty people
(Americans) were drowned on the <i>Lusitania</i> and we are
still writing notes about it&mdash;to the damnedest pirates that
ever blew up a ship. Anybody who knows the Germans
knows, of course, that they are simply playing for time,
that they are not going to &quot;come down,&quot; that Von Tirpitz
is on deck, that they'd just as lief have war with us as not&mdash;perhaps
had rather&mdash;because they don't want any large
nation left fresh when the war ends. They'd like to have
the whole world bankrupt. There is a fast growing feeling
here, therefore, that the American Government is pusillanimous&mdash;dallies
with 'em, is affected by the German propaganda,
etc., etc. Of course, such a judgment is not fair.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-26" id="page2-26"></a>[pg II-26]</span>
It is formed without knowing the conditions in the United
States. But I think you ought to realize the strength of
this sentiment. No doubt before you receive this, the
President will send something to Germany that will
amount to an ultimatum and there will be at least a momentary
change of sentiment here. But looking at the
thing in a long-range way, we're bound to get into the war.
For the Germans will blow up more American travellers
without notice. And by dallying with them we do not
change the ultimate result, but we take away from ourselves
the spunk and credit of getting in instead of being kicked
and cursed in. We've got to get in: they won't play the
game in any other way. I have news direct from a high
German source in Berlin which strongly confirms this....</p>

<p>It's a curious thing to say. But the only solution that
I see is another <i>Lusitania</i> outrage, which would force war.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P.S. The London papers every day say that the President
will send a strong note, etc. And the people here
say, &quot;Damn notes: hasn't he written enough?&quot; Writing
notes hurts nobody&mdash;changes nothing. The Washington
correspondents to the London papers say that Burleson,
the Attorney-General, and Daniels are Bryan men and
are holding the President back.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The prophecy contained in this letter was quickly fulfilled.
A week or two after Colonel House had received
it, the <i>Arabic</i> was sunk with loss of American life.</p>

<p>Page was taking a brief holiday with his son Frank in
Rowsley, Derbyshire, when this news came. It was telegraphed
from the Embassy.</p>

<p>&quot;That settles it,&quot; he said to his son. &quot;They have sunk
the <i>Arabic</i>. That means that we shall break with Germany
and I've got to go back to London.&quot;</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>The sinking of the <i>Arabic</i> is the answer to the President
and to your letter to me. And there'll be more such answers.
You said to me one day after you had got back
from your last visit to Berlin: &quot;They are impossible.&quot;
I think you told the truth, and surely you know your German
and you know your Berlin&mdash;or you did know them
when you were here.</p>

<p>The question is not what we have done for the Allies,
not what any other neutral country has done or has failed
to do&mdash;such comparisons, I think, are far from the point.
The question is when the right moment arrives for us to
save our self-respect, our honour, and the esteem and fear
(or the contempt) in which the world will hold us.</p>

<p>Berlin has the Napoleonic disease. If you follow Napoleon's
career&mdash;his excuses, his evasions, his inventions,
the wild French enthusiasm and how he kept it up&mdash;you
will find an exact parallel. That becomes plainer every
day. Europe may not be wholly at peace in five years&mdash;may
be ten.</p></div>

<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
London, September 2nd, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>You write me about pleasing the Allies, the big Ally in
particular. That doesn't particularly appeal to me. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-28" id="page2-28"></a>[pg II-28]</span>
don't owe them anything. There's no obligation. I'd
never confess for a moment that we are under any obligation
to any of them nor to anybody. I'm not out to
&quot;please&quot; anybody, as a primary purpose: that's not my
game nor my idea&mdash;nor yours either. As for England in
particular, the account was squared when she twice sent
an army against us&mdash;in her folly&mdash;especially the last time
when she burnt our Capitol. There's been no obligation
since. The obligation is on the other foot. We've set
her an example of what democracy will do for men, an
example of efficiency, an example of freedom of opportunity.
The future is ours, and she may follow us and
profit by it. Already we have three white English-speaking
men to every two in the British Empire: we
are sixty per cent. of the Anglo-Saxons in the world. If
there be any obligation to please, the obligation is on her
to please us. And she feels and sees it now.</p>

<p>My point is not that, nor is it what we or any other
neutral nation has done or may do&mdash;Holland or any other.
This war is the direct result of the over-polite, diplomatic,
standing-aloof, bowing-to-one-another in gold lace, which
all European nations are guilty of in times of peace&mdash;castes
and classes and uniforms and orders and such
folderol, instead of the proper business of the day. Every
nation in Europe knew that Germany was preparing
for war. If they had really got together&mdash;not mere
Hague Sunday-school talk and resolutions&mdash;but had
really got together for business and had said to Germany,
&quot;The moment you fire a shot, we'll all fight
against you; we have so many millions of men, so many
men-of-war, so many billions of money; and we'll increase
all these if you do not change your system and your
building-up of armies&quot;&mdash;then there would have been no
war.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-29" id="page2-29"></a>[pg II-29]</span>
<p>My point is not sentimental. It is:</p>

<p>(1) We must maintain our own self-respect and
safety. If we submit to too many insults, <i>that</i> will in
time bring Germany against us. We've got to show at
some time that we don't believe, either, in the efficacy of
Sunday-School resolves for peace&mdash;that we are neither
Daughters of the Dove of Peace nor Sons of the Olive
Branch, and</p>

<p>(2) About nagging and forever presenting technical
legal points as lawyers do to confuse juries&mdash;the point is
the point of efficiency. If we do that, we can't carry
our main points. I find it harder and harder to get
answers now to important questions because we ask so
many unimportant and nagging ones.</p>

<p>I've no sentiment&mdash;perhaps not enough. My gushing
days are gone, if I ever had 'em. The cutting-out of the
&quot;100 years of peace&quot; oratory, etc., etc., was one of the
blessings of the war. But we must be just and firm and
preserve our own self-respect and keep alive the fear that
other nations have of us; and we ought to have the courage
to make the Department of State more than a bureau
of complaints. We must learn to say &quot;No&quot; even to a
Gawdamighty independent American citizen when he
asks an improper or impracticable question. Public
Opinion in the United States consists of something more
than the threats of Congressmen and the bleating of newspapers;
it consists of the judgment of honourable men on
courageous and frank actions&mdash;a judgment that cannot
be made up till action is taken.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>I take it for granted that Dumba<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" /><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is going, of course.
But I must tell you that the President is being laughed
at by our best friends for his slowness in action. I hardly
ever pick up a paper without seeing some sarcastic remark.
I don't mean they expect us to come into the war.
They only hoped we would be as good as our word&mdash;would
regard another submarine attack on a ship carrying
Americans as an unfriendly act and would send Bernstorff
home. Yet the <i>Arabic</i> and now the <i>Hesperian</i> have
had no effect in action. Bernstorff's personal <i>note to
Lansing<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" /><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, even as far as it goes, does not bind his Government</i>.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that the President is fast losing
in the minds of our best friends here all that he gained
by his courageous stand on the Panama tolls. They feel
that if he takes another insult&mdash;keeps taking them&mdash;and
is satisfied with Bernstorff's personal word, which is
proved false in four days&mdash;he'll take anything. And the
British will pay less attention to what we say. That's
inevitable. If the American people and the President
accept the <i>Arabic</i> and the <i>Hesperian</i> and do nothing to
Dumba till the Government here gave out his letter,
which the State Department had (and silently held) for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-31" id="page2-31"></a>[pg II-31]</span>
several days&mdash;then nobody on this side the world will
pay much heed to anything we say hereafter.</p>

<p>This, as I say, doesn't mean that these (thoughtful)
people wish or expect us to go to war. They wish only
that we'd prove ourselves as good as the President's word.
That's the conservative truth; we're losing influence
more rapidly than I supposed it were possible.</p>

<p>Dumba's tardy dismissal will not touch the main
matter, which is the rights of neutrals at sea, and keeping
our word in action.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
London, Tuesday night, Sept. 8, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>The Germans seem to think it a good time to try to
feel about for peace. They have more to offer now than
they may have again. That's all. A man who seriously
talks peace now in Paris or in London on any terms that
the Germans will consider, would float dead that very
night in the Seine or in the Thames. The Germans have
for the time being &quot;done-up&quot; the Russians; but the
French have shells enough to plough the German trenches
day and night (they've been at it for a fortnight now);
Joffre has been to see the Italian generalissimo; and the
English destroy German submarines now almost as fast
as the Germans send them out. I am credibly told that
several weeks ago a group of Admiralty men who are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-32" id="page2-32"></a>[pg II-32]</span>
the secret had a little dinner to celebrate the destruction
of the 50th submarine.</p>

<p>While this is going on, you are talking on your side of
the water about a change in German policy! The only
change is that the number of submarines available becomes
smaller and smaller, and that they wish to use
Uncle Sam's broad, fat back to crawl down on when
they have failed.</p>

<p>Consequently, they are laughing at Uncle Sam here&mdash;it
comes near to being ridicule, in fact, for seeming to
jump at Bernstorff's unfrank assurances. And, as I
have telegraphed the President, English opinion is&mdash;well,
it is very nearly disrespectful. Men say here (I
mean our old friends) that with no disavowal of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, the <i>Falaba</i>, the <i>Gulflight</i>, or the <i>Arabic</i> or of the
<i>Hesperian</i>, the Germans are &quot;stuffing&quot; Uncle Sam, that
Uncle Sam is in the clutches of the peace-at-any-price
public opinion, that the United States will suffer any
insult and do nothing. I hardly pick up a paper that
does not have a sarcastic paragraph or cartoon. We are
on the brink of convincing the English that we'll not
act, whatever the provocation. By the English, I do
not mean the lighter, transitory public opinion, but I
mean the thoughtful men who do not wish us or expect
us to fire a gun. They say that the American democracy,
since Cleveland's day, has become a mere agglomeration
of different races, without national unity, national aims,
and without courage or moral qualities. And (I deeply
regret to say) the President is losing here the high esteem
he won by his Panama tolls repeal. They ask, why on
earth did he raise the issue if under repeated provocation
he is unable to recall Gerard or to send Bernstorff home?
The <i>Hesperian</i> follows the <i>Arabic</i>; other &quot;liners&quot; will
follow the <i>Hesperian</i>, if the Germans have submarines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-33" id="page2-33"></a>[pg II-33]</span>
And, when Sackville-West<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" /><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was promptly sent home for
answering a private citizen's inquiry about the two political
parties, Dumba is (yet awhile) retained in spite of a far
graver piece of business. There is a tone of sad disappointment
here&mdash;not because the most thoughtful men want us
in the war (they don't), but because for some reason, which
nobody here understands, the President, having taken a
stand, seems unable to do anything.</p>

<p>All this is a moderate interpretation of sorrowful
public opinion here. And the result will inevitably be
that they will pay far less heed to anything we may hereafter
say. In fact men now say here every day that the
American democracy has no opinion, can form no opinion,
has no moral quality, and that the word of its President
never gets as far as action even of the mildest form. The
atmosphere is very depressing. And this feeling has apparently
got beyond anybody's control. I've even heard
this said: &quot;The voice of the United States is Mr. Wilson's:
its actions are controlled by Mr. Bryan.&quot;</p>

<p>So, you see, the war will go on a long long time. So far as
English opinion is concerned, the United States is useful
to make ammunition and is now thought of chiefly in
this connection. Less and less attention is paid to what
we say. Even the American telegrams to the London
papers have a languid tone.</p>

<p>Yet recent revelations have made it clearer than ever
that the same qualities that the English accuse us of
having are in them and that these qualities are directly
to blame for this war. I recall that when I was in Germany
a few weeks, six years ago, I became convinced that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-34" id="page2-34"></a>[pg II-34]</span>
Germany had prepared to fight England; I didn't know
when, but I did know that was what the war-machine had
in mind. Of course, I had no opportunities to find out
anything in particular. You were told practically that
same thing by the Kaiser, before the war began. &quot;We
are ready,&quot; said he. Of course the English feared it and
Sir Edward put his whole life into his effort to prevent it.
The day the war began, he told me with tears that it
seemed that his life had been wasted&mdash;that his life work
had gone for naught.&mdash;Nobody could keep from wondering
why England didn't&mdash;</p>

<p>(Here comes a parenthesis. Word came to me a little
while ago that a Zeppelin was on its way to London.
Such a remark doesn't arouse much attention. But just
as I had finished the fifth line above this, Frank and Mrs.
Page came in and challenged me to play a game of cards
before we should go to bed. We sat down, the cards
were dealt, and bang! bang!&mdash;with the deep note of an
explosion. A third, a fourth shot. We went into the
street. There the Zeppelin was revealed by a searchlight&mdash;sailing
along. I think it had probably dropped its
bombs; but the aircraft guns were cracking away at it.
Some of them shot explosive projectiles to find the range.
Now and then one such explosive would almost reach the
Zeppelin, but it was too high for them and it sailed away,
the air guns doing their ineffectual best. I couldn't see
whether airplanes were trying to shoot it or not. The
searchlight revealed the Zeppelin but nothing else.&mdash;While
we were watching this battle in the air, the maids
came down from the top of the house and went into the
cellar. I think they've already gone back. You can't
imagine how little excitement it caused. It produces
less fright than any other conceivable engine of war.</p>

<p>We came back as soon as the Zeppelin was out of sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-35" id="page2-35"></a>[pg II-35]</span>
and the firing had ceased; we played our game of cards;
and here I am writing you the story-all within about
half an hour.&mdash;There was a raid over London last
night, too, wherein a dozen or two women and children
and a few men were killed. I haven't the slightest idea
what harm this raid to-night has done. For all I know
it may not be all done. But of all imaginable war-experiences
this seems the most futile. It interrupted a
game of cards for twenty minutes!)</p>

<p>Now&mdash;to go on with my story: I have wondered ever
since the war began why the Allies were not better
prepared&mdash;especially England on land. England has just
one <i>big</i> land gun&mdash;no more. Now it has turned out, as
you have doubtless read, that the British Government
were as good as told by the German Government that
Germany was going to war pretty soon&mdash;this in 1912 when
Lord Haldane<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" /><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was sent to make friends with Germany.</p>

<p>The only answer he brought back was a proposition
that England should in any event remain neutral&mdash;stand
aside while Germany whipped Russia and France. This
insulting proposal was kept secret till the other day.
Now, why didn't the British Cabinet inform the people
and get ready? They were afraid the English people
wouldn't believe it and would accuse them of fomenting
war. The English people were making money and pursuing
their sports. Probably they wouldn't have believed
it. So the Liberal Cabinet went on in silence,
knowing that war was coming, but not exactly when it
was coming, and they didn't make even a second big gun.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-36" id="page2-36"></a>[pg II-36]</span>
<p>Now here was the same silence in this &quot;democracy&quot;
that they now complain of in ours. Rather an interesting
and discouraging parallel&mdash;isn't it? Public opinion
has turned Lord Haldane out of office because he didn't
tell the public what he declares they wouldn't have believed.
If the English had raised an army in 1912, and
made a lot of big guns, Austria would not have trampled
Serbia in the earth. There would have been no war
now; and the strong European Powers might have made
then the same sort of protective peace-insurance combine
that they will try to make after this war is ended.
Query: A democracy's inability to <i>act</i>&mdash;how much is this
apparently inherent quality of a democracy to blame for
this war and for&mdash;other things?</p>

<p>When I am asked every day &quot;Why the United States
doesn't <i>do</i> something&mdash;send Dumba and Bernstorff
home?&quot;&mdash;Well, it is not the easiest question in the world
to answer.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours heartily,<br />
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P.S. This is the most comical of all worlds: While I
was writing this, it seems the maids went back upstairs
and lighted their lights without pulling their shades down&mdash;they
occupy three rooms, in front. The doorbell rang
furiously. Here were more than half a dozen policemen
and special constables&mdash;must investigate! &quot;One light
would be turned on, another would go out; another one
on!&quot;&mdash;etc., etc. Frank tackled them, told 'em it was only
the maids going to bed, forgetting to pull down the shades.
Spies and signalling were in the air! So, in the morning,
I'll have to send over to the Foreign Office and explain.
The Zeppelin did more &quot;frightfulness&quot; than I had supposed,
after all. Doesn't this strike you as comical?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P.S. The news is just come that Dumba is dismissed.
That will clear the atmosphere&mdash;a little, but only a little.
Dumba committed a diplomatic offence. The German
Government has caused the death of United States citizens,
has defied us, has declared it had changed its policy
and yet has gone on with the same old policy. Besides,
Bernstorff has done everything that Dumba did except
employ Archibald, which was a mere incident of the
game. The President took a strong stand: they have
disregarded it&mdash;no apology nor reparation for a single
boat that has been sunk. Now the English opinion of
the Germans is hardly a calm, judicial opinion&mdash;of course
not. There may be facts that have not been made
known. There must be good reasons that nobody here
can guess, why the President doesn't act in the long succession
of German acts against us. <i>But I tell you with
all solemnity that British opinion and the British Government
have absolutely lost their respect for us and their former
high estimate of the President. And that former respect is
gone for good unless he acts now very quickly</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" /><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. They will
pay nothing more than formal and polite attention to
anything we may hereafter say. This is not resentful.
They don't particularly care for us to get into the war.
Their feeling (I mean among our best old friends) is not
resentful. It is simply sorrowful. They had the highest
respect for our people and our President. The Germans
defy us; we sit in silence. They conclude here that we'll
submit to anything from anybody. We'll write strong
notes&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>I can't possibly exaggerate the revulsion of feeling.
Members of the Government say (in private, of course)
that we'll submit to any insult. The newspapers refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-38" id="page2-38"></a>[pg II-38]</span>
to publish articles which attempt to make the President's
silence reasonable. &quot;It isn't defensible,&quot; they say,
&quot;and they would only bring us thousands of insulting
letters from our readers.&quot; I can't think of a paper nor
of a man who has a good word to say for us&mdash;except,
perhaps, a few Quaker peace-at-any-price people. And
our old friends are disappointed and sorrowful. They
feel that we have dropped out of a position of influence
in the world.</p>

<p>I needn't and can't write more. Of course there are
more important things than English respect. But the
English think that every Power has lost respect for us&mdash;the
Germans most of all. And (unless the President acts
very rigorously and very quickly) we'll have to get along
a long time without British respect.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>The insulting cartoon that I enclose (destroy it without
showing it) is typical of, I suppose, five hundred that
have appeared here within a month. This represents the
feeling and opinion of the average man. They say we
wrote brave notes and made courageous demands, to
none of which a satisfactory reply has come, but only
more outrages and no guarantee for the future. Yet
we will not even show our displeasure by sending Bernstorff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-39" id="page2-39"></a>[pg II-39]</span>
home. We've simply &quot;gone out,&quot; like a snuffed
candle, in the regard and respect of the vast volume of
British opinion. (The last <i>Punch</i> had six ridiculing
allusions to our &quot;fall.&quot;)</p>

<p>It's the loneliest time I've had in England. There's a
tendency to avoid me.</p>

<p>They can't understand here the continued declaration
in the United States that the British Government is
trying to take our trade&mdash;to use its blockade and navy
with the direct purpose of giving British trade profit out
of American detentions. Of course, the Government had
no such purpose and has done no such thing&mdash;with any
such purpose. It isn't thinking about trade but only
about war.</p>

<p>The English think they see in this the effect on our
Government and on American opinion of the German
propaganda. I have had this trade-accusation investigated
half a dozen times&mdash;the accusation that this Government
is using its military power for its own trade advantage
to our detriment: it simply isn't true. They stop
our cargoes, not for their advantage, but wholly to keep
things from the enemy. Study our own trade reports.</p>

<p>In a word, our importers are playing (so the English
think) directly into the hands of the Germans. So matters
go on from bad to worse.</p>

<p>Bryce<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" /><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is very sad. He confessed to me yesterday
the utter hopelessness of the two people's ever understanding
one another.</p>

<p>The military situation is very blue&mdash;very blue. The
general feeling is that the long war will begin next March
and end&mdash;nobody dares predict.</p></div>

Department has a piece of the torpedo.</p></div>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The letters which Page sent directly to the President
were just as frank. &quot;Incidents occur nearly every day,&quot;
he wrote to President Wilson in the autumn of 1915,
&quot;which reveal the feeling that the Germans have taken
us in. Last week one of our naval men, Lieutenant
McBride, who has just been ordered home, asked the
Admiralty if he might see the piece of metal found on
the deck of the <i>Hesperian</i>. Contrary to their habit, the
British officer refused. 'Take my word for it,' he said.
'She was torpedoed. Why do you wish to investigate?
Your country will do nothing&mdash;will accept any excuse,
any insult and&mdash;do nothing.' When McBride told me
this, I went at once to the Foreign Office and made a
formal request that this metal should be shown to our
naval attach&eacute;, who (since Symington is with the British
fleet and McBride has been ordered home) is Lieutenant
Towers. Towers was sent for and everything that the
Admiralty knows was shown to him and I am sending
that piece of metal by this mail. But to such a pass
has the usual courtesy of a British naval officer come.
There are many such instances of changed conduct.
They are not hard to endure nor to answer and are of no
consequence in themselves but only for what they denote.
They're a part of war's bitterness. But my mind runs
ahead and I wonder how Englishmen will look at this
subject five years hence, and it runs afield and I wonder
how the Germans will regard it. A sort of pro-German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-41" id="page2-41"></a>[pg II-41]</span>
American newspaper correspondent came along the other
day from the German headquarters; and he told me that
one of the German generals remarked to him: 'War with
America? Ach no! Not war. If trouble should come,
we'd send over a platoon of our policemen to whip your
little army.' (He didn't say just how he'd send 'em.)&quot;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
American Embassy, London, Oct. 5, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>I have two letters that I have lately written to you but
which I have not sent because they utterly lack good
cheer. After reading them over, I have not liked to send
them. Yet I should fail of my duty if I did not tell you
bad news as well as good.</p>

<p>The high esteem in which our Government was held
when the first <i>Lusitania</i> note to Germany was sent seems
all changed to indifference or pity&mdash;not hatred or
hostility, but a sort of hopeless and sad pity. That ship
was sunk just five months ago; the German Government
(or its Ambassador) is yet holding conversations about
the principle involved, making &quot;concessions&quot; and promises
for the future, and so far we have done nothing to
hold the Germans to accountability<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10" /><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. In the meantime
their submarine fleet has been so reduced that probably
the future will take care of itself and we shall be used as a
sort of excuse for their failure. This is what the English
think and say; and they explain our failure to act by concluding
that the peace-at-any-price sentiment dominates
the Government and paralyzes it. They have now, I
think, given up hope that we will ever take any action.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-42" id="page2-42"></a>[pg II-42]</span>
So deeply rooted (and, I fear, permanent) is this feeling
that every occurrence is made to fit into and to strengthen
this supposition. When Dumba was dismissed, they said:
&quot;Dumba, merely the abject tool of German intrigue.
Why not Bernstorff?&quot; When the Anglo-French loan<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" /><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
was oversubscribed, they said: &quot;The people's sympathy
is most welcome, but their Government is paralyzed.&quot;
Their respect has gone&mdash;at least for the time being.</p>

<p>It is not that they expect us to go to war: many, in fact,
do not wish us to. They expected that we would be as
good as our word and hold the Germans to accountability.
Now I fear they think little of our word. I shudder to
think what our relations might be if Sir Edward Grey
were to yield to another as Foreign Minister, as, of course,
he must yield at some time.</p>

<p>The press has less to say than it had a few weeks ago.
<i>Punch</i>, for instance, which ridiculed and pitied us in six
cartoons and articles in each of two succeeding numbers,
entirely forgets us this week. But they've all said their
say. I am, in a sense, isolated&mdash;lonely in a way that I
have never before been. I am not exactly avoided, I
hope, but I surely am not sought. They have a polite
feeling that they do not wish to offend me and that to
make sure of this the safest course is to let me alone.
There is no mistaking the great change in the attitude of
men I know, both in official and private life.</p>

<p>It comes down and comes back to this&mdash;that for five
months after the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> the Germans are
yet playing with us, that we have not sent Bernstorff
home, and hence that we will submit to any rebuff or any
indignity. It is under these conditions&mdash;under this judgment
of us&mdash;that we now work&mdash;the English respect for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-43" id="page2-43"></a>[pg II-43]</span>
our Government indefinitely lessened and instead of the
old-time respect a sad pity. I cannot write more.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Heartily yours,<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>


<p>&quot;I have authoritatively heard,&quot; Page writes to President
Wilson in early September, &quot;of a private conversation between
a leading member of the Cabinet and a group of important
officials all friendly to us in which all sorrowfully
expressed the opinion that the United States will submit
to any indignity and that no effect is now to be hoped for
from its protests against unlawful submarine attacks or
against anything else. The inactivity of our Government,
or its delay, which they assume is the same as inactivity,
is attributed to domestic politics or to the lack of national,
consciousness or unity.</p>

<p>&quot;No explanation has appeared in the British press of
our Government's inactivity or of any regret or promise of
reparation by Germany for the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>,
the <i>Falaba</i>, the <i>Gulflight</i>, the <i>Nebraskan</i>, the <i>Arabic</i>, or
the <i>Hesperian</i>, nor any explanation of a week's silence
about the Dumba letter; and the conclusion is drawn
that, in the absence of action by us, all these acts have
been practically condoned.</p>

<p>&quot;I venture to suggest that such explanations be made
public as will remove, if possible, the practically unanimous
conclusion here that our Government will permit these and
similar future acts to be explained away. I am surprised
almost every hour by some new evidence of the loss of respect
for our Government, which, since the sinking of the
<i>Arabic</i>, has become so great as to warrant calling it a complete
revulsion of English feeling toward the United States.
There is no general wish for us to enter the war, but there
is genuine sorrow that we are thought to submit to any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-44" id="page2-44"></a>[pg II-44]</span>
indignity, especially after having taken a firm stand. I
conceive I should be lacking in duty if I did not report
this rapid and unfortunate change in public feeling, which
seems likely to become permanent unless facts are quickly
made public which may change it.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There are many expressions of such feelings in Page's
letters of this time. They brought only the most perfunctory
acknowledgment from the White House. On
January 3, 1916, Page sent the President a mass of clippings
from the British press, all criticizing the Wilson Administration
in unrestrained terms. In his comment on
these, he writes the President:</p>

<p>&quot;Public opinion, both official and unofficial, is expressed
by these newspaper comments, with far greater restraint
than it is expressed in private conversation. Ridicule of
the Administration runs through the programmes of the
theatres; it inspires hundreds of cartoons; it is a staple of
conversation at private dinners and in the clubs. The
most serious class of Englishmen, including the best
friends of the United States, feel that the Administration's
reliance on notes has reduced our Government to a third-or
fourth-rate power. There is even talk of spheres of
German influence in the United States as in China. No
government could fall lower in English opinion than we
shall fall if more notes are sent to Austria or to Germany.
The only way to keep any shred of English respect is the
immediate dismissal without more parleying of every
German and Austrian official at Washington. Nobody
here believes that such an act would provoke war.</p>

<p>&quot;I can do no real service by mincing matters. My
previous telegrams and letters have been purposely restrained
as this one is. We have now come to the parting
of the ways. If English respect be worth preserving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-45" id="page2-45"></a>[pg II-45]</span>
at all, it can be preserved only by immediate action.
Any other course than immediate severing of diplomatic
relations with both Germany and Austria will deepen the
English opinion into a conviction that the Administration
was insincere when it sent the <i>Lusitania</i> notes and
that its notes and protests need not be taken seriously on
any subject. And English opinion is allied opinion. The
Italian Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" /><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> said to me, 'What has happened?
The United States of to-day is not the United States I
knew fifteen years ago, when I lived in Washington.'
French officers and members of the Government who
come here express themselves even more strongly than
do the British. The British newspapers to-day publish
translations of ridicule of the United States from German
papers.&quot;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
London,<br />
January 5, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>I wish&mdash;an impossible thing of course&mdash;that some sort
of guidance could be given to the American correspondents
of the English newspapers. Almost every day they telegraph
about the visits of the Austrian Charg&eacute; or the
German Ambassador to the State Department to assure
Mr. Lansing that their governments will of course make a
satisfactory explanation of the latest torpedo-act in the
Mediterranean or to &quot;take one further step in reaching a
satisfactory understanding about the <i>Lusitania</i>.&quot; They
usually go on to say also that more notes are in preparation
to Germany or to Austria. The impression made upon
the European mind is that the German and Austrian
officials in Washington are leading the Administration on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-46" id="page2-46"></a>[pg II-46]</span>
to endless discussion, endless notes, endless hesitation.
Nobody in Europe regards their pledges or promises as
worth anything at all: the <i>Arabic</i> follows the <i>Lusitania</i>,
the <i>Hesperian</i> follows the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Persia</i> follows the
<i>Ancona</i>. &quot;Still conferences and notes continue,&quot; these
people say, &quot;proving that the American Government,
which took so proper and high a stand in the <i>Lusitania</i>
notes, is paralyzed&mdash;in a word is hoodwinked and 'worked'
by the Germans.&quot; And so long as these diplomatic
representatives are permitted to remain in the United
States, &quot;to explain,&quot; &quot;to parley&quot; and to declare that the
destruction of American lives and property is disavowed
by their governments, atrocities on sea and land will of
course continue; and they feel that our Government, by
keeping these German and Austrian representatives in
Washington, condones and encourages them and their
governments.</p>

<p>This is a temperate and even restrained statement of the
English feeling and (as far as I can make out) of the whole
European feeling.</p>

<p>It has been said here that every important journal
published in neutral or allied European countries, daily,
weekly, or monthly, which deals with public affairs, has
expressed a loss of respect for the United States Government
and that most of them make continuous severe
criticisms (with surprise and regret) of our failure by action
to live up to the level of our <i>Lusitania</i> notes. I had
(judiciously) two American journalists, resident here&mdash;men
of judgment and character&mdash;to inquire how true this
declaration is. After talking with neutral and allied
journalists here and with men whose business it is to read
the journals of the Continent, they reported that this
declaration is substantially true&mdash;that the whole European
press (outside Germany and its allies) uses the same tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-47" id="page2-47"></a>[pg II-47]</span>
toward our Government that the English press uses&mdash;to-day,
disappointment verging on contempt; and many
of them explain our keeping diplomatic intercourse with
Germany by saying that we are afraid of the German vote,
or of civil war, or that the peace-at-any-price people really
rule the United States and have paralyzed our power to
act&mdash;even to cut off diplomatic relations with governments
that have insulted and defied us.</p>

<p>Another (similar) declaration is that practically all men
of public influence in England and in the European allied
and neutral countries have publicly or privately expressed
themselves to the same effect. The report that I have
about this is less definite than about the newspapers, for,
of course, no one can say just what proportion of men of
public influence have so expressed themselves; but the
number who have so expressed themselves is overwhelming.</p>

<p>In this Kingdom, where I can myself form some opinion
more or less accurate, and where I can check or verify my
opinion by various methods&mdash;I am afraid, as I have frequently
already reported, that the generation now living
will never wholly regain the respect for our Government
that it had a year ago. I will give you three little indications
of this feeling; it would be easy to write down hundreds
of them:</p>

<p>(One) The governing class: Mr. X [a cabinet member]
told Mrs. Page a few nights ago that for sentimental reasons
only he would be gratified to see the United States in
the war along with the Allies, but that merely sentimental
reasons were not a sufficient reason for war&mdash;by no means;
that he felt most grateful for the sympathetic attitude of
the large mass of the American people, that he had no
right to expect anything from our Government, whose
neutral position was entirely proper. Then he added;
&quot;But what I can't for the life of me understand is your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-48" id="page2-48"></a>[pg II-48]</span>
Government's failure to express its disapproval of the
German utter disregard of its <i>Lusitania</i> notes. After
eight months, it has done nothing but write more notes.
My love for America, I must confess, is offended at this
inaction and&mdash;puzzled. I can't understand it. You
will pardon me, I am sure.&quot;</p>

<p>(Two) &quot;Middle Class&quot; opinion: A common nickname
for Americans in the financial and newspaper districts of
London is &quot;Too-prouds.&quot;</p>

<p>(Three) The man in the street: At one of the moving
picture shows in a large theatre a little while ago they filled
in an interval by throwing on the screen the picture of the
monarch, or head of state, and of the flag of each of the
principal nations. When the American picture appeared,
there was such hissing and groaning as caused the managers
hastily to move that picture off the screen.</p>

<p>Some time ago I wrote House of some such incidents
and expressions as these; and he wrote me that they were
only part and parcel of the continuous British criticism
of their own Government&mdash;in other words, a part of the
passing hysteria of war. This remark shows how House
was living in an atmosphere of illusion.</p>

<p>As the matter stands to-day our Government has sunk
lower, as regards British and European opinion, than it
has ever been in our time, not as a part of the hysteria of
war but as a result of this process of reasoning, whether it
be right or wrong:</p>

<p>We said that we should hold the Germans to strict accountability
on account of the <i>Lusitania</i>. We have not
settled that yet and we still allow the German Ambassador
to discuss it after the <i>Hesperian</i> and other such acts
showed that his <i>Arabic</i> pledge was worthless.</p>

<p>The <i>Lusitania</i> grows larger and larger in European
memory and imagination. It looks as if it would become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-49" id="page2-49"></a>[pg II-49]</span>
the great type of war atrocities and barbarities. I have
seen pictures of the drowned women and children used
even on Christmas cards. And there is documentary
proof in our hands that the warning, which was really an
advance announcement, of that disaster was paid for by
the German Ambassador and charged to his Government.
It is the <i>Lusitania</i> that has caused European opinion to
regard our foreign policy as weak. It is not the wish for
us to go to war. No such general wish exists.</p>

<p>I do not know, Mr. President, who else, if anybody,
puts these facts before you with this complete frankness.
But I can do no less and do my duty.</p>

<p>No Englishman&mdash;except two who were quite intimate
friends&mdash;has spoken to me about our Government for
months, but I detect all the time a tone of pity and grief
in their studied courtesy and in their avoidance of the
subject. And they talk with every other American in
this Kingdom. It is often made unpleasant for Americans
in the clubs and in the pursuit of their regular business
and occupations; and it is always our inaction about
the <i>Lusitania</i>. Our controversy with the British Government
causes little feeling and that is a sort of echo of the
<i>Lusitania</i>. They feel that we have not lived up to our
promises and professions.</p>

<p>That is the whole story.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Believe me always heartily,<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This dismissal of Dumba and of the Attach&eacute;s has had
little more effect on opinion here than the dismissal of
the Turkish Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" /><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Sending these was regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-50" id="page2-50"></a>[pg II-50]</span>
merely kicking the dogs of the man who had stolen our
sheep.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>One of the reasons why Page felt so intensely about
American policy at this time was his conviction that the
severance of diplomatic relations, in the latter part of 1915,
or the early part of 1916, in itself would have brought the
European War to an end. This was a conviction from
which he never departed. Count Bernstorff was industriously
creating the impression in the United States that
his dismissal would immediately cause war between Germany
and the United States, and there is little doubt
that the Administration accepted this point of view. But
Page believed that this was nothing but Prussian bluff.
The severance of diplomatic relations at that time, in
Page's opinion, would have convinced the Germans of the
hopelessness of their cause. In spite of the British
blockade, Germany was drawing enormous quantities of
food supplies from the United States, and without these
supplies she could not maintain indefinitely her resistance.
The severance of diplomatic relations would
naturally have been accompanied by an embargo suspending
trade between the United States and the Fatherland.
Moreover, the consideration that was mainly
leading Germany to hope for success was the belief that
she could embroil the United States and Great Britain
over the blockade. A break with Germany would of
course mean an end to that manoeuvre. Page regarded
all Mr. Wilson's attempts to make peace in 1914 and early
1915&mdash;before the <i>Lusitania</i>&mdash;as mistakes, for reasons that
have already been set forth. Now, however, he believed
that the President had a real opportunity to end
the war and the unparalleled suffering which it was causing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-51" id="page2-51"></a>[pg II-51]</span>
The mere dismissal of Bernstorff, in the Ambassador's
opinion, would accomplish this result.</p>

<p>In a communication sent to the President on February
15, 1916, he made this plain.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
February 15, 7 P.M.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Cabinet has directed the Censor to suppress, as far
as he can with prudence, comment which is unfavourable
to the United States. He has taken this action because
the public feeling against the Administration is constantly
increasing. Because the <i>Lusitania</i> controversy has been
going on so long, and because the Germans are using it in
their renewed U-boat campaign, the opinion of this country
has reached a point where only prompt action can
bring a turn in the tide. Therefore my loyalty to you
would not be complete if I should refrain from sending,
in the most respectful terms, the solemn conviction which
I hold about our opportunity and our duty.</p>

<p>If you immediately refuse to have further parley or to
yield one jot or tittle of your original <i>Lusitania</i> notes, and
if you at once break diplomatic relations with the German
Empire, and then declare the most vigorous embargo of
the Central Powers, you will quickly end the war. There
will be an immediate collapse in German credit. If there
are any Allies who are wavering, such action will hold
them in line. Certain European neutrals&mdash;Sweden, Rumania,
Greece, and others&mdash;will put up a firm resistance
to Germanic influences and certain of them will take part
with Great Britain and France. There will be an end at
once to the German propaganda, which is now world-wide.
The moral weight of our country will be a determining
influence and bring an early peace. The credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-52" id="page2-52"></a>[pg II-52]</span>
you will receive for such a decision will make you immortal
and even the people of Germany will be forever grateful.</p>

<p>It is my conviction that we would not be called upon
to fire a gun or to lose one human life.</p>

<p>Above all, such an action will settle the whole question
of permanent peace. The absolute and grateful loyalty
of the whole British Empire, of the British Fleet, and of
all the Allied countries will be ours. The great English-speaking
nations will be able to control the details of the
peace and this without any formal alliance. There will
be an incalculable saving of human life and of treasure.
Such an act will make it possible for Germany to give in
honourably and with good grace because the whole world
will be against her. Her bankrupt and blockaded people
will bring such pressure to bear that the decision will be
hastened.</p>

<p>The sympathies of the American people will be brought
in line with the Administration.</p>

<p>If we settle the <i>Lusitania</i> question by compromising
in any way your original demands, or if we permit it to
drag on longer, America can have no part in bringing the
war to an end. The current of allied opinion will run so
strongly against the Administration that no censorship
and no friendly interference by an allied government
can stem the distrust of our Government which is now so
strong in Europe.</p>

<p>We shall gain by any further delay only a dangerous,
thankless, and opulent isolation. The <i>Lusitania</i> is the
turning point in our history. The time to act is now.</p></div>

<h3>THE AMBASSADOR AND THE LAWYERS</h3>

<p>References in the foregoing letters show that
Page was still having his troubles over the blockade.
In the latter part of 1915, indeed, the negotiations with
Sir Edward Grey on this subject had reached their second
stage. The failure of Washington to force upon Great
Britain an entirely new code of naval warfare&mdash;the Declaration
of London&mdash;has already been described. This
failure had left both the British Foreign Office and the
American State Department in an unsatisfactory frame
of mind. The Foreign Office regarded Washington with
suspicion, for the American attempt to compel Great
Britain to adopt a code of naval warfare which was exceedingly
unfavourable to that country and exceedingly
favourable to Germany, was susceptible of a sinister interpretation.
The British rejection of these overtures, on
the other hand, had evidently irritated the international
lawyers at Washington. Mr. Lansing now abandoned
his efforts to revolutionize maritime warfare and confined
himself to specific protests and complaints. His communications
to the London Embassy dealt chiefly with particular
ships and cargoes. Yet his persistence in regarding
all these problems from a strictly legalistic point of view
Page regarded as indicating a restricted sense of statesmanship.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-54" id="page2-54"></a>[pg II-54]</span></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
London, August 4, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>... The lawyer-way in which the Department
goes on in its dealings with Great Britain is losing us the
only great international friendship that we have any
chance of keeping or that is worth having. Whatever
real principle we have to uphold with Great Britain&mdash;that's
all right. I refer only to the continuous series of
nagging incidents&mdash;always criticism, criticism, criticism
of small points&mdash;points that we have to yield at last, and
never anything constructive. I'll illustrate what I mean
by a few incidents that I can recall from memory. If I
looked up the record, I should find a very, very much
larger list.</p>

<p>(1) We insisted and insisted and insisted, not once but
half a dozen times, at the very beginning of the war, on
England's adoption of the Declaration of London entire
in spite of the fact that Parliament had distinctly declined
to adopt it. Of course we had to give in&mdash;after we had
produced a distinctly unfriendly atmosphere and much
feeling.</p>

<p>(2) We denied the British right to put copper on the
contraband list&mdash;much to their annoyance. Of course
we had at last to acquiesce. They were within their
rights.</p>

<p>(3) We protested against bringing ships into port to
examine them. Of course we had to give in&mdash;after producing
irritation.</p>

<p>(4) We made a great fuss about stopped telegrams.
We have no case at all; but, even after acknowledging
that we have no case, every Pouch continues to bring
telegrams with the request that I ask an explanation why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-55" id="page2-55"></a>[pg II-55]</span>
they were stopped. Such explanations are practically
refused. I have 500 telegrams. Periodically I wire the
state of the case and ask for more specific instructions.
I never get an answer to these requests. But the Department
continues to send the telegrams! We confessedly
have no case here; and this method can produce nothing
but irritation.</p>

<p>I could extend this list to 100 examples&mdash;of mere lawyer-like
methods&mdash;mere useless technicalities and objections
which it is obvious in the beginning cannot be maintained.
A similar method is now going on about cotton. Now
this is not the way Sir Edward Grey takes up business.
It's not the way I've done business all my life, nor that
you have, nor other frank men who mean what they say
and do not say things they do not mean. The constant
continuation of this method is throwing away the real regard
and confidence of the British Government and of the
British public&mdash;very fast, too.</p>

<p>I sometimes wish there were not a lawyer in the world.
I heard the President say once that it took him twenty
years to recover from his legal habit of mind. Well, his
Administration is suffering from it to a degree that is
pathetic and that will leave bad results for 100 years.</p>

<p>I suspect that in spite of all the fuss we have made we
shall at last come to acknowledge the British blockade;
for it is pretty nearly parallel to the United States blockade
of the South during our Civil War. The only difference
is&mdash;they can't make the blockade of the Baltic
against the traffic from the Scandinavian neutral states
effective. That's a good technical objection; but, since
practically all the traffic between those States and Germany
is in our products, much of the real force of it is
lost.</p>

<p>If a protest is made against cotton being made contraband&mdash;it'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-56" id="page2-56"></a>[pg II-56]</span>
amount to nothing and give only irritation.
It will only play into Hoke Smith<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" /><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;German hands and
accomplish nothing here. We make as much fuss about
points which we have silently to yield later as about a
real principle. Hence they all say that the State Department
is merely captious, and they pay less and less attention
to it and care less and less for American opinion&mdash;if
only they can continue to get munitions. We are reducing
English regard to this purely mercenary basis....</p>

<p>We are&mdash;under lawyers' quibbling&mdash;drifting apart very
rapidly, to our complete isolation from the sympathy of
the whole world.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours forever sincerely,<br />

</div>

<p>Page refers in this letter to the &quot;blockade&quot;; this was
the term which the British Government itself used to describe
its restrictive measures against German commerce,
and it rapidly passed into common speech. Yet the truth
is that Great Britain never declared an actual blockade
against Germany. A realization of this fact will clear up
much that is obscure in the naval warfare of the next two
years. At the beginning of the Civil War, President
Lincoln laid an interdict on all the ports of the Confederacy;
the ships of all nations were forbidden entering or
leaving them: any ship which attempted to evade this
restriction, and was captured doing so, was confiscated,
with its cargo. That was a blockade, as the term has
always been understood. A blockade, it is well to keep
in mind, is a procedure which aims at completely closing
the blockaded country from all commercial intercourse
with the world. A blockading navy, if the blockade is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-57" id="page2-57"></a>[pg II-57]</span>
successful, or &quot;effective,&quot; converts the whole country into
a beleaguered fortress, just as an army, surrounding a
single town, prevents goods and people from entering or
leaving it. Precisely as it is the purpose of a besieging
army to starve a particular city or territory into submission,
so it is the aim of a blockading fleet to enforce the
same treatment on the nation as a whole. It is also essential
to keep in mind that the question of contraband has
nothing to do with a blockade, for, under this drastic
method of making warfare, everything is contraband.
Contraband is a term applied to cargoes, such as rifles,
machine guns, and the like, which are needed in the prosecution
of war.</p>

<p>That a belligerent nation has the right to intercept
such munitions on the way to its enemy has been admitted
for centuries. Differences of opinion have raged only as
to the extent to which this right could be carried&mdash;the
particular articles, that is, that constituted contraband,
and the methods adopted in exercising it. But the important
point to be kept in mind is that where there is
a blockade, there is no contraband list&mdash;for everything
automatically becomes contraband. The seizure of contraband
on the high seas is a war measure which is availed
of only in cases in which the blockade has not been established.</p>

<p>Great Britain, when she declared war on Germany, did
not follow President Lincoln's example and lay the whole
of the German coast under interdict. Perhaps one reason
for this inaction was a desire not unduly to offend neutrals,
especially the United States; but the more impelling motive
was geographical. The fact is that a blockade of the
German seacoast would accomplish little in the way of
keeping materials out of Germany. A glance at the map
of northwestern Europe will make this fact clear. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-58" id="page2-58"></a>[pg II-58]</span>
first place the seacoast of Germany is a small affair. In
the North Sea the German coast is a little indentation,
not more than two hundred miles long, wedged in between
the longer coastlines of Holland and Denmark; in the
Baltic it is somewhat more extensive, but the entrances
to this sea are so circuitous and treacherous that the suggestion
of a blockade here is not a practicable one. The
greatest ports of Germany are located on this little North
Sea coastline or on its rivers&mdash;Hamburg and Bremen. It
might therefore be assumed that any nation which successfully
blockaded these North Sea ports would have strangled
the commerce of Germany. That is far from being the
case. The point is that the political boundaries of Germany
are simply fictions, when economic considerations
are involved. Holland, on the west, and Denmark, on
the north, are as much a part of the German transportation
system as though these two countries were parts of
the German Empire. Their territories and the territories
of Germany are contiguous; the railroad and the canal
systems of Germany, Holland, and Denmark are practically
one. Such ports as Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and
Copenhagen are just as useful to Germany for purposes of
commerce as are Hamburg and Bremen, and, in fact, a
special commercial arrangement with Rotterdam has
made that city practically a port of Germany since 1868.
These considerations show how ineffective would be a
blockade of the German coast which did not also comprehend
the coast of Holland and Denmark. Germany
could still conduct her commerce through these neighbouring
countries. And at this point the great difficulty
arose. A blockade is an act of war and can be applied
only to a country upon which war has been declared.
Great Britain had declared war on Germany and could
therefore legally close her ports; she had not declared war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-59" id="page2-59"></a>[pg II-59]</span>
on Holland and Denmark, and therefore could not use the
same measure against those friendly countries. Consequently
the blockade was useless to Great Britain; and so,
in the first six months of the war, the Admiralty fell back
upon the milder system of declaring certain articles contraband
of war and seizing ships that were suspected of
carrying them to Germany.</p>

<p>A geographical accident had apparently largely destroyed
the usefulness of the British fleet and had guaranteed
Germany an unending supply of those foodstuffs
without which she could not maintain her resistance for
any extended period. Was Great Britain called upon to
accept this situation and to deny herself the use of the
blockade in this, the greatest struggle in her history?
Unless the British fleet could stop cargoes which were
really destined to Germany but which were bound for
neutral ports, Great Britain could not win the war; if the
British fleet could intercept such cargoes, then the chances
strongly favoured victory. The experts of the Foreign
Office searched the history of blockades and found something
which resembled a precedent in the practices of the
American Navy during the Civil War. In that conflict
Nassau, in the Bahamas, and Matamoros, in Mexico,
played a part not unlike that played by Rotterdam and
Copenhagen in the recent struggle. These were both
neutral ports and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the
United States, just as Rotterdam and Copenhagen were
outside the jurisdiction of Great Britain. They were the
ports of powers with which the United States was at
peace, and therefore they could not be blockaded, just as
Amsterdam and Copenhagen were ports of powers with
which Great Britain was now at peace.</p>

<p>Trade from Great Britain to the Bahamas and Mexico
was ostensibly trade from one neutral port to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-60" id="page2-60"></a>[pg II-60]</span>
neutral port in the same sense as was trade from the
United States to Holland and Denmark. Yet the fact is
that the &quot;neutrality&quot; of this trade, in the Civil War, from
Great Britain to the Bahamas and Mexico, was the most
transparent subterfuge; such trade was not &quot;neutral&quot; in
the slightest degree. It consisted almost entirely of
contraband of war and was intended for the armies of the
Confederate States, then in arms against the Federal
Government. What is the reason, our Government
asked, that these gentle and unwarlike inhabitants of the
Bahamas have so suddenly developed such an enormous
appetite for percussion caps, rifles, cannon, and other
instruments of warfare? The answer, of course, lay upon
the surface; the cargoes were intended for reshipment into
the Southern States, and they were, in fact, immediately
so reshipped. The American Government, which has
always regarded realities as more important than logic,
brushed aside the consideration that this trade was conducted
through neutral ports, unhesitatingly seized these
ships and condemned both the ships and their cargoes.
Its action was without legal precedent, but our American
courts devised a new principle of international law to
cover the case&mdash;that of &quot;continuous voyage&quot; or &quot;ultimate
destination.&quot; Under this new doctrine it was maintained
that cargoes of contraband could be seized anywhere upon
the high seas, even though they were going from one neutral
port to another, if it could be demonstrated that this
contraband was really on its way to the enemy. The
mere fact that it was transshipped at an intermediate
neutral port was not important; the important point was
the &quot;ultimate destination.&quot; British shippers naturally
raged over these decisions, but they met with little sympathy
from their own government. Great Britain filed
no protest against the doctrine of &quot;continuous voyage,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-61" id="page2-61"></a>[pg II-61]</span>
but recognized its fundamental soundness, and since 1865
this doctrine has been a part of international law.</p>

<p>Great Britain's good sense in acquiescing in our Civil
War practices now met its reward; for these decisions of
American courts proved a godsend in her hour of trial.
The one neutral from which trouble was anticipated was
the United States. What better way to meet this situation
than to base British maritime warfare upon the decisions
of American courts? What more ideal solution of the
problem than to make Chief Justice Chase, of the United
States Supreme Court, really the author of the British
&quot;blockade&quot; against Germany? The policy of the British
Foreign Office was to use the sea power of Great Britain
to crush the enemy, but to do it in a way that would
not alienate American sympathy and American support;
clearly the one way in which both these ends could be
attained was to frame these war measures upon the
pronouncements of American prize courts. In a broad sense
this is precisely what Sir Edward Grey now proceeded to
do. There was a difference, of course, which Great
Britain's enemies in the American Senate&mdash;such men as
Senator Hoke Smith, of Georgia, and Senator Thomas
Walsh, of Montana&mdash;proceeded to point out; but it was a
difference of degree. Great Britain based her blockade
measures upon the American principle of &quot;ultimate destination,&quot;
but it was necessary considerably to extend
that doctrine in order to meet the necessities of the new
situation. President Lincoln had applied this principle
to absolute contraband, such as powder, shells, rifles, and
other munitions of war. Great Britain now proceeded to
apply it to that nebulous class of commodities known as
&quot;conditional contraband,&quot; the chief of which was foodstuffs.
If the United States, while a war was pending,
could evolve the idea of &quot;ultimate destination&quot; and apply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-62" id="page2-62"></a>[pg II-62]</span>
it to absolute contraband, could not Great Britain, while
another war was pending, carry it one degree further and
make it include conditional contraband? Thus reasoned
the British Foreign Office. To this Mr. Lansing replied
that to stop foodstuffs on the way to Germany through a
neutral port was simply to blockade a neutral port, and
that this was something utterly without precedent. Seizing
contraband is not an act of war against the nation
whose ships are seized; blockading a port is an act of war;
what right therefore had Great Britain to adopt measures
against Holland, Denmark, and Sweden which virtually
amounted to a blockade?</p>

<p>This is the reason why Great Britain, in the pronouncement
of March 1, 1915, and the Order in Council of March
11, 1915, did not describe these measures as a &quot;blockade.&quot;
President Wilson described his attack on Mexico in 1914
as &quot;measures short of war,&quot; and now someone referred to
the British restrictions on neutral commerce as &quot;measures
short of blockade.&quot; The British sought another escape
from their predicament by justifying this proceeding,
not on the general principles of warfare, but on the ground
of reprisal. Germany declared her submarine warfare
on merchant ships on February 4, 1915; Great Britain
replied with her announcement of March 1st, in which
she declared her intention of preventing &quot;commodities of
any kind from reaching or leaving Germany.&quot; The British
advanced this procedure as a retaliation for the illegal
warfare which Germany had declared on merchant shipping,
both that of the enemy and of neutrals. &quot;The
British and French governments will therefore hold
themselves free to detain and take into port ships carrying
goods of presumed enemy destination, ownership, and
origin.&quot; This sentence accurately describes the purposes
of a blockade&mdash;to cut the enemy off from all commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-63" id="page2-63"></a>[pg II-63]</span>
relations with the outside world; yet the procedure Great
Britain now proposed to follow was not that of a blockade.
When this interdict is classically laid, any ship that attempts
to run the lines is penalized with confiscation,
along with its cargo; but such a penalty was not to be
exacted in the present instance. Great Britain now proposed
to purchase cargoes of conditional contraband discovered
on seized ships and return the ships themselves to
their owners, and this soon became the established practice.
Not only did the Foreign Office purchase all cotton
which was seized on its way to Germany, but it took measures
to maintain the price in the markets of the world.
In the succeeding months Southern statesmen in both
Houses of Congress railed against the British seizure of
their great staple, yet the fact was that cotton was all this
time steadily advancing in price. When Senator Hoke
Smith made a long speech advocating an embargo on the
shipment of munitions as a punishment to Great Britain
for stopping American cotton on the way to Germany,
the acute John Sharp Williams, of Mississippi, arose in the
Senate and completely annihilated the Georgia politician
by demonstrating how the Southern planters were growing
rich out of the war.</p>

<p>That the so-called &quot;blockade&quot; situation was a tortuous
one must be apparent from this attempt to set forth the
salient facts. The basic point was that there could be no
blockade of Germany unless the neutral ports of contiguous
countries were also blockaded, and Great Britain
believed that she had found a precedent for doing this in
the operations of the American Navy in the Civil War.
But it is obvious that the situation was one which would
provide a great feast for the lawyers. That Page sympathized
with this British determination to keep foodstuffs
out of Germany, his correspondence shows. Day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-64" id="page2-64"></a>[pg II-64]</span>
after day the &quot;protests&quot; from Washington rained upon
his desk. The history of our foreign relations for 1915
and 1916 is largely made up of an interminable correspondence
dealing with seized cargoes, and the routine of
the Embassy was an unending nightmare of &quot;demands,&quot;
&quot;complaints,&quot; &quot;precedents,&quot; &quot;cases,&quot; &quot;notes,&quot; &quot;detentions&quot;
of Chicago meats, of Southern cotton, and the like.
The American Embassy in London contains hundreds of
volumes of correspondence which took place during Page's
incumbency; more material has accumulated for those five
years than for the preceding century and a quarter of the
Government's existence. The greater part of this mass
deals with intercepted cargoes.</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter which Page wrote
at this time gives a fair idea of the atmosphere that prevailed
in London while this correspondence was engaging
the Ambassador's mind:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The truth is, in their present depressed mood, the
United States is forgotten&mdash;everything's forgotten but
the one great matter in hand. For the moment at least,
the English do not care what we do or what we think or
whether we exist&mdash;except those critics of things-in-general
who use us as a target since they must take a crack at
somebody. And I simply cannot describe the curious
effect that is produced on men here by the apparent utter
lack of understanding in the United States of the phase
the war has now entered and of the mood that this phase
has brought. I pick up an American paper eight days old
and read solemn evidence to show that the British Government
is interrupting our trade in order to advance
its own at our expense, whereas the truth is that the
British Government hasn't given six seconds' thought in
six months to anybody's trade&mdash;not even its own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-65" id="page2-65"></a>[pg II-65]</span>
When I am asked to inquire why Pfister and Schmidt's
telegram from New York to Schimmelpfenig and Johann
in Holland was stopped (the reason is reasonably obvious),
I try to picture to myself the British Minister in Washington
making inquiry of our Government on the day after
Bull Run, why the sailing boat loaded with persimmon
blocks to make golf clubs is delayed in Hampton Roads.</p>

<p>I think I have neither heard nor read anything from
the United States in three months that didn't seem so
remote as to suggest the captain of the sailing ship from
Hongkong who turned up at Southampton in February
and had not even heard that there was a war. All day
long I see and hear women who come to ask if I can make
inquiry about their sons and husbands, &quot;dead or missing,&quot;
with an interval given to a description of a man half of
whose body was splashed against a brick wall last night on
the Strand when a Zeppelin bomb tore up the street and
made projectiles of the pavement; as I walk to and from
the Embassy the Park is full of wounded and their nurses;
every man I see tells me of a new death; every member of
the Government talks about military events or of Balkan
venality; the man behind the counter at the cigar store
reads me part of a letter just come from his son, telling
how he advanced over a pile of dead Germans and one of
them grunted and turned under his feet-they (the English
alone) are spending $25,000,000 a day to keep this
march going over dead Germans; then comes a telegram
predicting blue ruin for American importers and a
cheerless Christmas for American children if a cargo of
German toys be not quickly released at Rotterdam, and
I dimly recall the benevolent unction with which American
children last Christmas sent a shipload of toys to
this side of the world&mdash;many of them for German children&mdash;to
the tune of &quot;God bless us all&quot;&mdash;do you wonder we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-66" id="page2-66"></a>[pg II-66]</span>
often have to pinch ourselves to find out if we are we; and
what year of the Lord is it? What is the vital thing&mdash;the
killing of fifty people last night by a Zeppelin within
sight of St. Paul's on one side and of Westminster Abbey
on the other, or is it making representations to Sir Edward
Grey, who has hardly slept for a week because his
despatches from Sofia, Athens, Belgrade, and Salonika
come at all hours, each possibly reporting on which side
a new government may throw its army&mdash;to decide perhaps
the fate of the canal leading to Asia, the vast British
Asiatic empire at stake&mdash;is it making representations to
Sir Edward while his mind is thus occupied, that it is of
the greatest importance to the United States Government
that a particular German who is somewhere in this Kingdom
shall be permitted to go to the United States because
he knows how to dye sealskins and our sealskins are
yet undyed and the winter is coming? There will be no
new sealskins here, for every man and woman must give
half his income to keep the cigarman's son marching over
dead Germans, some of whom grunt and turn under his
feet. Dumba is at Falmouth to-day and gets just two
lines in the newspapers. Nothing and nobody gets three
lines unless he or it in some way furthers the war. Every
morning the Washington despatches say that Mr. Lansing
is about to send a long note to England. England
won't read it till there comes a lull in the fighting or in
the breathless diplomatic struggle with the Balkans.
London and the Government are now in much the same
mood that Washington and Lincoln's administration
were in after Lee had crossed the Potomac on his way to
Gettysburg. Northcliffe, the Lord of Yellow Journals,
but an uncommonly brilliant fellow, has taken to his bed
from sheer nervous worry. &quot;The revelations that are
imminent,&quot; says he, &quot;will shake the world&mdash;the incompetence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-67" id="page2-67"></a>[pg II-67]</span>
of the Government, the losses along the Dardanelles,
the throwing away of British chances in the Balkans,
perhaps the actual defeat of the Allies.&quot; I regard
Lord Northcliffe less as an entity than as a symptom.
But he is always very friendly to us and he knows the
United States better than any Englishman that I know
except Bryce. He and Bryce are both much concerned
about our Note's coming just &quot;at this most distressing
time.&quot; &quot;If it come when we are calmer, no matter; but
now it cannot receive attention and many will feel that
the United States has hit on a most unhappy moment&mdash;almost
a cruel moment&mdash;to remind us of our sins.&quot;&mdash;That's
the substance of what they say.</p>

<p>Overwork, or perhaps mainly the indescribable strain
on the nerves and vitality of men, caused by this experience,
for which in fact men are not built, puts one of
our staff after another in bed. None has been seriously
sick: the malady takes some form of &quot;grip.&quot; On the
whole we've been pretty lucky in spite of this almost
regular temporary breakdown of one man after another.
I've so far escaped. But I am grieved to hear that
Whitlock is abed&mdash;&quot;no physical ailment whatever&mdash;just
worn out,&quot; his doctor says. I have tried to induce him
and his wife to come here and make me a visit; but one
characteristic of this war-malady is the conviction of the
victim that he is somehow necessary to hold the world
together. About twice a week I get to the golf links and
take the risk of the world's falling apart and thus escape
both illness and its illusions.</p></div>

<p>&quot;I cannot begin to express my deep anxiety and even
uneasiness about the relations of these two great governments
and peoples,&quot; Page wrote about this time.
&quot;The friendship of the United States and Great Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-68" id="page2-68"></a>[pg II-68]</span>
is all that now holds the world together. It is the greatest
asset of civilization left. All the cargoes of copper and
oil in the world are not worth as much to the world. Yet
when a shipper's cargo is held up he does not think of
civilization and of the future of mankind and of free
government; he thinks only of his cargo and of the indignity
that he imagines has been done him; and what is
the American Government for if not to protect his rights?
Of course he's right; but there must be somebody somewhere
who sees things in their right proportion. The
man with an injury rushes to the Department of State&mdash;quite
properly. He is in a mood to bring England to
book. Now comes the critical stage in the journey of his
complaint. The State Department hurries it on to me&mdash;very
properly; every man's right must be guarded and defended&mdash;a
right to get his cargo to market, a right to get
on a steamer at Queenstown, a right to have his censored
telegram returned, any kind of a right, if he have a right.
Then the Department, not wittingly, I know, but humanly,
almost inevitably, in the great rush of overwork,
sends his 'demands' to me, catching much of his tone and
apparently insisting on the removal of his grievance as a
right, without knowing all the facts in the case. The
telegrams that come to me are full of 'protests' and
'demands'&mdash;protest and demand this, protest and demand
that. A man from Mars who should read my book of
telegrams received during the last two months would find
it difficult to explain how the two governments have kept
at peace. It is this serious treatment of trifling grievances
which makes us feel here that the exactions and dislocations
and necessary disturbances of this war are not
understood at home.</p>

<p>&quot;I assure you (and there are plenty of facts to prove it)
that this Government (both for unselfish and selfish reasons)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-69" id="page2-69"></a>[pg II-69]</span>
puts a higher value on our friendship than on any
similar thing in the world. They will go&mdash;they are
going&mdash;the full length to keep it. But, in proportion to
our tendency to nag them about little things will the value
set on our friendship diminish and will their confidence in
our sincerity decline.&quot;</p>

<p>The note which Lord Bryce and Lord Northcliffe so
dreaded reached the London Embassy in October, 1915.
The State Department had spent nearly six months in
preparing it; it was the American answer to the so-called
blockade established by the Order in Council of the preceding
March. Evidently its contents fulfilled the worst
forebodings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
London, November 12, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>I have a great respect for the British Navy. Admiral
Jellicoe now has under his command 3,000 ships of all
sorts-far and away the biggest fleet, I think, that was
ever assembled. For the first time since the ocean was
poured out, one navy practically commands all the seas:
nothing sails except by its grace. It is this fleet of course
that will win the war. The beginning of the end&mdash;however
far off yet the end may be&mdash;is already visible by reason
of the economic pressure on Germany. But for this
fleet, by the way, London would be in ruins, all its treasure
looted; every French seacoast city and the Italian
peninsula would be as Belgium and Poland are; and thousands
of English women would be violated&mdash;just as dead
French girls are found in many German trenches that have
been taken in France. Hence I greatly respect the British
fleet.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-70" id="page2-70"></a>[pg II-70]</span>
<p>We have a good navy, too, for its size, and a naval personnel
as good as any afloat. I hear&mdash;with much joy&mdash;that
we are going to make our navy bigger&mdash;as much
bigger (God save the mark!) as Bryan will permit.</p>

<p>Now, whatever the future bring, since any fighting
enterprise that may ever be thrust on us will be just and
justified, we must see to it that we win, as doubtless we
shall and as hitherto we always have won. We must be
dead sure of winning. Well, whatever fight may be
thrust on us by anybody, anywhere, at any time, for any
reason&mdash;if it only be generally understood beforehand that
our fleet and the British fleet shoot the same language,
there'll be no fight thrust upon us. The biggest bully in
the world wouldn't dare kick the sorriest dog we have.
Here, therefore, is a Peace Programme for you&mdash;the
only basis for a permanent peace in the world. There's
no further good in having venerable children build houses
of sand at The Hague; there's no further good in peace
organizations or protective leagues to enforce peace. We
had as well get down to facts. So far as ensuring peace is
concerned the biggest fact in the world is the British fleet.
The next biggest fact is the American fleet, because of itself
and still more because of the vast reserve power of the
United States which it implies. If these two fleets perfectly
understand one another about the undesirability of
wars of aggression, there'll be no more big wars as long
as this understanding continues. Such an understanding
calls for no treaty&mdash;it calls only for courtesy.</p>

<p>And there is no other peace-basis worth talking about&mdash;by
men who know how the world is governed.</p>

<p>Since I have lived here I have spent my days and nights,
my poor brain, and my small fortune all most freely and
gladly to get some understanding of the men who rule
this Kingdom, and of the women and the customs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-71" id="page2-71"></a>[pg II-71]</span>
the traditions that rule these men&mdash;to get their trick of
thought, the play of their ideals, the working of their
imagination, the springs of their instincts. It is impossible
for any man to know just how well he himself does
such a difficult task&mdash;how accurately he is coming to
understand the sources and character of a people's actions.
Yet, at the worst, I do know something about the British:
I know enough to make very sure of the soundness
of my conclusion that they are necessary to us and we to
them. Else God would have permitted the world to be
peopled in some other way. And when we see that the
world will be saved by such an artificial combination as
England and Russia and France and Japan and Serbia, it
calls for no great wisdom to see the natural way whereby
it must be saved in the future.</p>

<p>For this reason every day that I have lived here it has
been my conscious aim to do what I could to bring about a
condition that shall make sure of this&mdash;that, whenever we
may have need of the British fleet to protect our shores or
to prevent an aggressive war anywhere, it shall he ours by
a natural impulse and necessity&mdash;even without the asking.</p>

<p>I have found out that the first step toward that end is
courtesy; that the second step is courtesy, and the third
step&mdash;such a fine and high courtesy (which includes
courage) as the President showed in the Panama tolls
controversy. We have&mdash;we and the British&mdash;common
aims and character. Only a continuous and sincere
courtesy&mdash;over periods of strain as well as of calm&mdash;is
necessary for as complete an understanding as will be required
for the automatic guidance of the world in peaceful
ways.</p>

<p>Now, a difference is come between us&mdash;the sort of
difference that handled as between friends would serve
only to bind us together with a sturdier respect. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-72" id="page2-72"></a>[pg II-72]</span>
send a long lawyer's Note, not discourteous but wholly
uncourteous, which is far worse. I am writing now only
of the manner of the Note, not of its matter. There is
not a courteous word, nor a friendly phrase, nor a kindly
turn in it, not an allusion even to an old acquaintance, to
say nothing of an old friendship, not a word of thanks for
courtesies or favours done us, not a hint of sympathy in
the difficulties of the time. There is nothing in its tone
to show that it came from an American to an Englishman:
it might have been from a Hottentot to a Fiji-Islander.</p>

<p>I am almost sure&mdash;I'll say quite sure&mdash;that this uncourteous
manner is far more important than its endless
matter. It has greatly hurt our friends, the real men of
the Kingdom. It has made the masses angry&mdash;which is
of far less importance than the severe sorrow that our
discourtesy of manner has brought to our friends&mdash;I fear
to all considerate and thoughtful Englishmen.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate: When the Panama tolls controversy
arose, Taft ceased to speak the language of the natural
man and lapsed into lawyer's courthouse zigzagging mutterings.
Knox wrote a letter to the British Government
that would have made an enemy of the most affectionate
twin brother&mdash;all mere legal twists and turns, as agreeable
as a pocketful of screws. Then various bovine &quot;international
lawyers&quot; wrote books about it. I read them and
became more and more confused the further I went: you
always do. It took me some time to recover from this
word-drunk debauch and to find my own natural intelligence
again, the common sense that I was born with.
Then I saw that the whole thing went wrong from the place
where that Knox legal note came in. Congressmen in the
backwoods quoted cryptic passages from it, thought they
were saying something, and proceeded to make their
audiences believe that somehow England had hit us with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-73" id="page2-73"></a>[pg II-73]</span>
a club&mdash;or would have hit us but for Knox. That pure
discourtesy kept us apart from English sympathy for
something like two years.</p>

<p>Then the President took it up. He threw the legal
twaddle into the gutter. He put the whole question in
a ten-minutes' speech to Congress, full of clearness and
fairness and high courtesy. It won even the rural Congressmen.
It was read in every capital and the men who
conduct every government looked up and said, &quot;This is a
real man, a brave man, a just man.&quot; You will recall what
Sir Edward Grey said to me: &quot;The President has taught us
all a lesson and set us all a high example in the noblest
courtesy.&quot;</p>

<p>This one act brought these two nations closer together
than they had ever been since we became an independent
nation. It was an act of courtesy....</p>

<p>My dear House, suppose the postman some morning
were to leave at your door a thing of thirty-five heads and
three appendices, and you discovered that it came from
an old friend whom you had long known and greatly
valued&mdash;this vast mass of legal stuff, without a word or a
turn of courtesy in it&mdash;what would you do? He had a
grievance, your old friend had. Friends often have.
But instead of explaining it to you, he had gone and had
his lawyers send this many-headed, much-appendiced
ton of stuff. It wasn't by that method that you found
your way from Austin, Texas, to your present eminence
and wisdom. Nor was that the way our friend found
his way from a little law-office in Atlanta, where I first
saw him, to the White House.</p>

<p>More and more I am struck with this&mdash;that governments
are human. They are not remote abstractions,
nor impersonal institutions. Men conduct them; and
they do not cease to be men. A man is made up of six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-74" id="page2-74"></a>[pg II-74]</span>
parts of human nature and four parts of facts and other
things&mdash;a little reason, some prejudice, much provincialism,
and of the particular fur or skin that suits his habitat.
When you wish to win a man to do what <i>you</i> want him to
do, you take along a few well-established facts, some reasoning
and such-like, but you take along also three or
four or five parts of human nature&mdash;kindliness, courtesy,
and such things&mdash;sympathy and a human touch.</p>

<p>If a man be six parts human and four parts of other
things, a government, especially a democracy, is seven, or
eight, or nine parts human nature. It's the most human
thing I know. The best way to manage governments
and nations&mdash;so long as they are disposed to be friendly&mdash;is
the way we manage one another. I have a confirmation
of this in the following comment which came to me
to-day. It was made by a friendly member of Parliament.</p>

<p>&quot;The President himself dealt with Germany. Even
in his severity he paid the Germans the compliment of a
most courteous tone in his Note. But in dealing with
us he seems to have called in the lawyers of German
importers and Chicago pork-packers. I miss the high
Presidential courtesy that we had come to expect from
Mr. Wilson.&quot;</p>

<p>An American banker here has told me of the experience
of an American financial salesman in the city the day
after our Note was published. His business is to make
calls on bankers and other financial men, to sell them securities.
He is a man of good address who is popular
with his clients. The first man he called on, on that day,
said: &quot;I don't wish to be offensive to you. But I have
only one way to show my feeling of indignation toward
the United States, and that is, to have nothing more to do
with Americans.&quot;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-75" id="page2-75"></a>[pg II-75]</span>
<p>The next man said: &quot;No, nothing to-day, I thank you.
No&mdash;nor to-morrow either; nor the next day. Good
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>After four or five such greetings, the fellow gave it up
and is now doing nothing.</p>

<p>I don't attach much importance to such an incident as
this, except as it gives a hint of the general feeling. These
financial men probably haven't even read our Note.
Few people have. But they have all read the short and
sharp newspaper summary which preceded it in the English
papers. But what such an incident does indicate is
the prevalence of a state of public feeling which would
prevent the Government from yielding any of our demands
even if the Government so wished. It has now been
nearly a week since the Note was published. I have seen
most of the neutral ministers. Before the Note came they
expressed great eagerness to see it: it would champion
their cause. Since it came not one of them has mentioned
it to me. The Secretary of one of them remarked, after
being invited to express himself: &quot;It is too&mdash;too&mdash;long!&quot;
And, although I have seen most of the Cabinet this week,
not a man mentioned it to me. People seem studiously
to avoid it, lest they give offense.</p>

<p>I have, however, got one little satisfaction. An American&mdash;a
half-expatriated loafer who talks &quot;art&quot;&mdash;you
know the intellectually affected and degenerate type&mdash;screwed
his courage up and told me that he felt ashamed
of his country. I remarked that I felt sure the feeling was
mutual. That, I confess, made me feel better.</p>

<p>As nearly as I can make out, the highwater mark of
English good-feeling toward us in all our history was after
the President's Panama tolls courtesy. The low-water
mark, since the Civil War, I am sure, is now. The Cleveland
Venezuela message came at a time of no nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-76" id="page2-76"></a>[pg II-76]</span>
strain and did, I think, produce no long-lasting effect.
A part of the present feeling is due to the English conviction
that we have been taken in by the Germans in the
submarine controversy, but a large part is due to the lack
of courtesy in this last Note&mdash;the manner in which it was
written even more than its matter. As regards its matter,
I have often been over what I conceive to be the main
points with Sir Edward Grey&mdash;very frankly and without
the least offense. He has said: &quot;We may have to arbitrate
these things,&quot; as he might say, &quot;We had better take
a cab because it is raining.&quot; It is easily possible&mdash;or it
was&mdash;to discuss anything with this Government without
offense. I have, in fact, stood up before Sir Edward's
fire and accused him of stealing a large part of the earth's
surface, and we were just as good friends afterward as before.
But I never drew a lawyer's indictment of him as a
land-thief: that's different.</p>

<p>I suppose no two peoples or governments ever quite understand
one another. Perhaps they never will. That is
too much to hope for. But when one government writes
to another it ought to write (as men do) with some reference
to the personality of the other and to their previous
relations, since governments are more human than men.
Of course I don't know who wrote the Note. Hence I
can talk about it freely to you without implying criticism
of anybody in particular. But the man who wrote it
never saw the British Government and wouldn't know it
if he met it in the road. To him it is a mere legal entity,
a wicked, impersonal institution against which he has the
task of drawing an indictment&mdash;not the task of trying to
persuade it to confess the propriety of a certain course of
conduct. In his view, it is a wicked enemy to start with&mdash;like
the Louisiana lottery of a previous generation or
the Standard Oil Company of our time.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-77" id="page2-77"></a>[pg II-77]</span>
<p>One would have thought, since we were six months in
preparing it, that a draft of the Note would have been
sent to the man on the ground whom our Government
keeps in London to study the situation at first hand and
to make the best judgment he can about the most effective
methods of approach on delicate and difficult matters.
If that had been done, I should have suggested a courteous
short Note saying that we are obliged to set forth such
and such views about marine law and the rights of neutrals,
to His Majesty's Government; and that the contention
of the United States Government was herewith
sent&mdash;etc., etc.&mdash;Then this identical Note (with certain
court-house, strong, shirt-sleeve adjectives left out)
could have come without arousing any feeling whatsoever.
Of course I have no personal vanity in saying this to you.
I am sure I outgrew that foible many years ago. But
such a use of an ambassador&mdash;of any ambassador&mdash;is
obviously one of the best and most natural uses he could
be put to; and all governments but ours do put their ambassadors
to such a use: that's what they have 'em for.</p>

<p><i>Per contra</i>: a telegram has just come in saying that a
certain Lichtenstein in New York had a lot of goods
stopped by the British Government, which (by an arrangement
made with their attorney here) agreed to buy
them at a certain price: will I go and find out why the
Government hasn't yet paid Lichtenstein and when he
may expect his money? Is it an ambassadorial duty to
collect a private bill for Lichtenstein, in a bargain with
which our Government has had nothing to do? I have
telegraphed the Department, quite calmly, that I don't
think it is. I venture to say no ambassador ever had such
a request as that before from his Government.</p>

<p>My dear House, I often wonder if my years of work
here&mdash;the kind of high good work I've tried to do&mdash;have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-78" id="page2-78"></a>[pg II-78]</span>
not been thrown away. I've tried to take and to busy
myself with a long-range view of great subjects. The
British Empire and the United States will be here long
after we are dead, and their relations will continue to be
one of the most important matters&mdash;perhaps the most
important matter&mdash;in the world. Well, now think of
Lichtenstein's bill!</p>

<p>To get back where I started&mdash;I fear, therefore, that,
when I next meet the Admiral of the Grand Fleet (with
whom I used to discuss everything quite freely before he
sailed away to the war), he may forget to mention that
we may have his 3,000 ships at our need.</p>

<p>Since this present difference is in danger of losing the
healing influence of a kindly touch&mdash;has become an uncourteous
monster of 35 heads and 3 appendices&mdash;I see no
early end of it. The British Foreign Office has a lot of
lawyers in its great back offices. They and our lawyers
will now butt and rebut as long as a goat of them is left
alive on either side. The two governments&mdash;the two
human, kindly groups&mdash;have retired: they don't touch, on
this matter, now. The lawyers will have the time of their
lives, each smelling the blood of the other.</p>

<p>If more notes must come&mdash;as the English papers report
over and over again every morning and every afternoon&mdash;the
President might do much by writing a brief, human
document to accompany the Appendices. If it be done
courteously, we can accuse them of stealing sheep and of
dyeing the skins to conceal the theft-without provoking
the slightest bad feeling; and, in the end, they'll pay
another <i>Alabama</i> award without complaint and frame
the check and show it to future ambassadors as Sir Edward
shows the <i>Alabama</i> check to me sometimes.</p>

<p>And it'll be a lasting shame (and may bring other Great
Wars) if lawyers are now permitted to tear the garments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-79" id="page2-79"></a>[pg II-79]</span>
with which Peace ought to be clothed as soon as she can
escape from her present rags and tatters.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours always heartily,<br />
<br />
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P.S. My dear House: Since I have&mdash;in weeks and
months past&mdash;both telegraphed and written the Department
(and I presume the President has seen what
I've sent) about the feeling here, I've written this letter
to you and not to the President nor Lansing. I will not
run the risk of seeming to complain&mdash;nor even of seeming
to seem to complain. But if you think it wise to send or
show this letter to the President, I'm willing you should.
This job was botched: there's no doubt about that. We
shall not recover for many a long, long year. The identical
indictment could have been drawn with admirable
temper and the way laid down for arbitration and for
keeping our interpretation of the law and precedents
intact&mdash;all done in a way that would have given no offense.</p>

<p>The feeling runs higher and higher every day&mdash;goes
deeper and spreads wider.</p>

<p>Now on top of it comes the <i>Ancona</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" /><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The English
press, practically unanimously, makes sneering remarks
about our Government. After six months it has got no
results from the <i>Lusitania</i> controversy, which Bernstorff
is allowed to prolong in secret session while factories are
blown up, ships supplied with bombs, and all manner of
outrages go on (by Germans) in the United States. The
English simply can't understand why Bernstorff is allowed
to stay. They predict that nothing will come of the
<i>Ancona</i> case, nor of any other case. Nobody wants us
to get into the war&mdash;nobody who counts&mdash;but they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-80" id="page2-80"></a>[pg II-80]</span>
losing respect for us because we seem to them to submit to
anything.</p>

<p>We've simply dropped out. No English person ever
mentions our Government to me. But they talk to one
another all the time about the political an&aelig;mia of the
United States Government. They think that Bernstorff
has the State Department afraid of him and that the
Pacifists dominate opinion&mdash;the Pacifists-at-any-price.
I no longer even have a chance to explain any of these
things to anybody I know.</p>

<p>It isn't the old question we used to discuss of our having
no friend in the world when the war ends. It's gone far
further than that. It is now whether the United States
Government need be respected by anybody.</p></div>

<h3>DARK DAYS FOR THE ALLIES</h3>


<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />

June 30, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>There's a distinct wave of depression here&mdash;perhaps
I'd better say a period of setbacks has come. So far as
we can find out only the Germans are doing anything in
the war on land. The position in France is essentially
the same as it was in November, only the Germans are
much more strongly entrenched. Their great plenty of
machine guns enables them to use fewer men and to kill
more than the Allies. The Russians also lack ammunition
and are yielding more and more territory. The Allies&mdash;so
you hear now&mdash;will do well if they get their little
army away from the Dardanelles before the German-Turks
eat 'em alive, and no Balkan state comes in to help
the Allies. Italy makes progress-slowly, of course,
over almost impassable mountains&mdash;etc., etc. Most of
this doleful recital I think is true; and I find more and
more men here who have lost hope of seeing an end of the
war in less than two or three years, and more and more
who fear that the Germans will never be forced out of
Belgium. And the era of the giant aeroplane seems about
to come&mdash;a machine that can carry several tons and
several men and go great distances&mdash;two engines, two
propellers, and the like. It isn't at all impossible, I am
told, that these machines may be the things that will at
last end the war&mdash;possibly, but I doubt it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-82" id="page2-82"></a>[pg II-82]</span>
<p>At any rate, it is true that a great wave of discouragement
is come. All these events and more seem to prove
to my mind the rather dismal failure the Liberal Government
made&mdash;a failure really to grasp the problem. It was
a dead failure. Of course they are waking up now, when
they are faced with a certain dread lest many soldiers
prefer frankly to die rather than spend another winter in
practically the same trenches. You hear rumours, too, of
great impending military scandals&mdash;God knows whether
there be any truth in them or not.</p>

<p>In a word, while no Englishman gives up or will ever
give up&mdash;that's all rot&mdash;the job he has in hand is not going
well. He's got to spit on his hands and buckle up his belt
two holes tighter yet. And I haven't seen a man for a
month who dares hope for an end of the fight within any
time that he can foresee.</p>

<p>I had a talk to-day with the Russian Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" /><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. He
wished to know how matters stood between the United
States and Great Britain. I said to him: &quot;I'll give you
a task if you have leisure. Set to and help me hurry up
your distinguished Ally in dealing with our shipping
troubles.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man laughed&mdash;that seemed a huge joke to
him; he threw up his hands and exclaimed&mdash;&quot;My God!
He is slow about his own business&mdash;has always been slow&mdash;can't
be anything else.&quot;</p>

<p>After more such banter, the nigger in his wood-pile
poked his head out: &quot;Is there any danger,&quot; he asked,
&quot;that munitions may be stopped?&quot;</p>

<p>The Germans have been preparing northern France for
German occupation. No French are left there, of course,
except women and children and old men. They must be
fed or starved or deported. The Germans put them on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-83" id="page2-83"></a>[pg II-83]</span>
trains&mdash;a whole village at a time&mdash;and run them to the
Swiss frontier. Of course the Swiss pass them on into
France. The French have their own and&mdash;the Germans
will have northern France without any French population,
if this process goes on long enough.</p>

<p>The mere bang! bang! frightful era of the war is passed.
The Germans are settling down to permanent business
with their great organizing machine. Of course they talk
about the freedom of the seas and such mush-mush; of
course they'd like to have Paris and rob it of enough
money to pay what the war has cost them, and London,
too. But what they really want for keeps is seacoast&mdash;Belgium
and as much of the French coast as they can win.
That's really what they are out gunning for. Of course,
somehow at some time they mean to get Holland, too,
and Denmark, if they really need it. Then they'll have
a very respectable seacoast&mdash;the thing that they chiefly
lack now.</p>

<p>More and more people are getting their nerves knocked
out. I went to a big hospital on Sunday, twenty-five
miles out of London. They showed me an enormous,
muscular Tommy sitting by himself in a chair under the
trees. He had had a slight wound which quickly got
well. But his speech was gone. That came back, too,
later. But then he wouldn't talk and he'd insist on
going off by himself. He's just knocked out&mdash;you can't
find out just how much gumption he has left. That's
what the war did for him: it stupefied him. Well, it's
stupefied lots of folks who have never seen a trench.
That's what's happened. Of all the men who started in
with the game, I verily believe that Lloyd George is holding
up best. He organized British finance. Now he's
organizing British industry.</p>

<p>It's got hot in London&mdash;hotter than I've ever known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-84" id="page2-84"></a>[pg II-84]</span>
it. It gets lonelier (more people going away) and sadder&mdash;more
wounded coming back and more visible sorrow.
We seem to be settling down to something that is more
or less like Paris&mdash;so far less, but it may become more and
more like it. And the confident note of an earlier period
is accompanied by a dull undertone of much less cheerfulness.
The end is&mdash;in the lap of the gods.</p></div>

American Embassy, London,<br />
<br />

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>... Many men here are very active in their
thought about the future relations of the United States
and Great Britain. Will the war bring or leave them
closer together? If the German machine be completely
smashed (and it may not be completely smashed) the
Japanese danger will remain. I do not know how to
estimate that danger accurately. But there is such a
danger. And, if the German wild beast ever come to life
again, there's an eternal chance of trouble with it. For
defensive purposes it may become of the very first importance
that the whole English-speaking world should
stand together&mdash;not in entangling alliance, but with a
much clearer understanding than we have ever yet had.
I'll indicate to you some of my cogitations on this subject
by trying to repeat what I told Philip Kerr<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" /><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a fortnight
ago&mdash;one Sunday in the country. I can write this
to you without seeming to parade my own opinions.&mdash;Kerr
is one of &quot;The Round Table,&quot; perhaps the best
group of men here for the real study and free discussion
of large political subjects. Their quarterly, <i>The Round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-85" id="page2-85"></a>[pg II-85]</span>
Table</i>, is the best review, I dare say, in the world. Kerr is
red hot for a close and perfect understanding between
Great Britain and the United States. I told him that,
since Great Britain had only about forty per cent. of
the white English-speaking people and the United States
had about sixty per cent., I hoped in his natural history
that the tail didn't wag the dog. I went on:</p>

<p>&quot;You now have the advantage of us in your aggregation
of three centuries of accumulated wealth&mdash;the spoil
of all the world&mdash;and in the talent that you have developed
for conserving it and adding to it and in the institutions
you have built up to perpetuate it&mdash;your merchant
ships, your insurance, your world-wide banking, your
mortgages on all new lands; but isn't this the only advantage
you have? This advantage will pass. You are
now shooting away millions and millions, and you will
have a debt that is bound to burden industry. On our
side, we have a more recently mixed race than yours;
you've begun to inbreed. We have also (and therefore)
more adaptability, a greater keenness of mind in our
masses; we are Old-World men set free&mdash;free of classes
and traditions and all that they connote. Your so-called
democracy is far behind ours. Your aristocracy
and your privileges necessarily bring a social and economic
burden. Half your people look backward.</p>

<p>&quot;Your leadership rests on your wealth and on the
power that you've built on your wealth.&quot;</p>

<p>When he asked me how we were to come closer together&mdash;&quot;closer
together, with your old-time distrust of
us and with your remoteness?&quot;&mdash;I stopped him at &quot;remoteness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the reason,&quot; I said. &quot;Your idea of our 'remoteness.'
'Remoteness' from what? From you? Are
you not betraying the only real difficulty of a closer sympathy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-86" id="page2-86"></a>[pg II-86]</span>
by assuming that you are the centre of the world?
When you bring yourself to think of the British Empire
as a part of the American Union&mdash;mind you, I am not
saying that you would be formally admitted&mdash;but when
you are yourselves in close enough sympathy with us to
wish to be admitted, the chief difficulty of a real union
of thought will be gone. You recall Lord Rosebery's
speech in which he pictured the capital of the British
Empire being moved to Washington if the American
Colonies had been retained under the Crown? Well, it
was the Crown that was the trouble, and the capital of
English-speaking folk has been so moved and you still
remain 'remote.' Drop 'remote' from your vocabulary
and your thought and we'll actually be closer together.&quot;</p>

<p>It's an enormous problem&mdash;just how to bring these
countries closer together. Perhaps nothing can do it but
some great common danger or some great common adventure.
But this is one of the problems of your lifetime.
England can't get itself clean loose from the continent
nor from continental medi&aelig;valism; and with that
we can have nothing to do. Men like Kerr think that
somehow a great push toward democracy here will be
given by the war. I don't quite see how. So far the
aristocracy have made perhaps the best showing in defence
of English liberty. They are paying the bills of
the war; they have sent their sons; these sons have died
like men; and their parents never whimper. It's a fine
breed for such great uses as these. There was a fine
incident in the House of Lords the other day, which gave
the lie to the talk that one used to hear here about
&quot;degeneracy.&quot; Somebody made a perfectly innocent proposal
to complete a list of peers and peers' sons who had
fallen in the war&mdash;a thing that will, of course, be done,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-87" id="page2-87"></a>[pg II-87]</span>
just as a similar list will be compiled of the House of
Commons, of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. But
one peer after another objected vigorously lest such a
list appear immodest. &quot;We are but doing our duty.
Let the matter rest there.&quot;</p>

<p>In a time like this the aristocracy proves its worth. In
fact, all aristocracies grew chiefly out of wars, and perhaps
they are better for wars than a real democracy. Here,
you see, you run into one of those contradictions in life
and history which make the world so hard to change....</p>

<p>You know there are some reasons why peace, whenever
it may come, will bring problems as bad as the problems
of the war itself. I can think of no worse task than the
long conferences of the Allies with their conflicting interests
and ambitions. Then must come their conferences
with the enemy. Then there are sure to be other
conferences to try to make peace secure. And, of course,
many are going to be dissatisfied and disappointed, and
perhaps out of these disappointments other wars may
come. The world will not take up its knitting and sit
quietly by the fire for many a year to come....</p></div>

<p>One happiness came to Mr. and Mrs. Page in the midst
of all these war alarums. On August 4, 1915, their only
daughter, Katharine, was married to Mr. Charles G.
Loring, of Boston, Massachusetts. The occasion gave the
King an opportunity of showing the high regard in which
Page and his family were held. It had been planned
that the wedding should take place in Westminster Abbey,
but the King very courteously offered Miss Page
the Royal chapel in St. James's Palace. This was a distinguished
compliment, as it was the first time that any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-88" id="page2-88"></a>[pg II-88]</span>
marriage, in which both bride and bridegroom were
foreigners, had ever been celebrated in this building, which
for centuries has been the scene of royal weddings. The
special place which his daughter had always held in the
Ambassador's affections is apparent in the many letters
that now followed her to her new home in the United
States. The unique use Page made of the initials of his
daughter's name was characteristic.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR K.A. P-TAIN:</p>

<p>Here's a joke on your mother and Frank: We three
(and Smith) went up to Broadway in the car, to stay
there a little while and then to go on into Wales, etc.
The hotel is an old curiosity shop; you sit on Elizabethan
chairs by a Queen Anne table, on a drunken floor,
and look at the pewter platters on the wall or do your best
to look at them, for the ancient windows admit hardly any
light. &quot;Oh! lovely,&quot; cries Frank; and then he and your
mother make out in the half-darkness a perfectly wonderful
copper mug on the mantelpiece; and you go out
and come in the ramshackle door (stooping every time)
after you've felt all about for the rusty old iron latch, and
then you step down two steps (or fall), presently to step
up two more. Well, for dinner we had six kinds of meat
and two meat pies and potatoes and currants! My
dinner was a potato. I'm old and infirm and I have
many ailments, but I'm not so bad off as to be able to
live on a potato a day. And since we were having a vacation,
I didn't see the point. So I came home where I
have seven courses for dinner, all good; and Mrs. Leggett
took my place in the car. That carnivorous company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-89" id="page2-89"></a>[pg II-89]</span>
went on. They've got to eat six kinds of meat and two
meat pies and&mdash;currants! I haven't. Your mother calls
me up on the phone every morning&mdash;me, who am living
here in luxury, seven courses at every dinner&mdash;and asks
anxiously, &quot;And how <i>are</i> you, dear?&quot; I answer: &quot;Prime,
and how are <i>you</i>?&quot; We are all enjoying ourselves, you
see, and I don't have to eat six kinds of meat and two
meat pies and&mdash;currants! They do; and may Heaven
save 'em and get 'em home safe!</p>

showers at night and Ranelagh beautiful, and few people
here; but I don't deny its loneliness&mdash;somewhat. Yet
sleep is good, and easy and long. I have neither an
ocean voyage nor six kinds of meat and two meat pies
and currants. I congratulate myself and write to you
and mother.</p>

<p>You'll land to-morrow or next day&mdash;good; I congratulate
you. Salute the good land for me and present my
respectful compliments to vegetables that have taste and
fruit that is not sour&mdash;to the sunshine, in fact, and to
everything that ripens and sweetens in its glow.</p>

<p>And you're now (when this reaches you) fixing up
your home&mdash;your <i>own</i> home, dear Kitty. Bless your
dear life, you left a home here&mdash;wasn't it a good and nice
one?&mdash;left it very lonely for the man who has loved you
twenty-four years and been made happy by your presence.
But he'll love you twenty-five more and on and
on&mdash;always. So you haven't lost that&mdash;nor can you.
And it's very fit and right that you should build your own
nest; that adds another happy home, you see. And I'm
very sure it will be very happy always. Whatever I can
do to make it so, now or ever, you have only to say.
But&mdash;your mother took your photograph with her and got
it out of the bag and put it on the bureau as soon as she

gratitude in his voice told me of the present that you and
Chud had made him. He is very genuinely pleased. As
for the rest, life goes on as usual.</p>

<p>I laugh as I think of all your new aunts and cousins
looking you over and wondering if you'll fit, and then
saying to one another as they go to bed: &quot;She is lovely&mdash;isn't
she?&quot; I could tell 'em a thing or two if I had a
whack at 'em.</p>

<p>And you'll soon have all your pretty things in place in
your pretty home, and a lot more that I haven't seen.
I'll see 'em all before many years&mdash;and you, too! Tell
me, did Chud get you a dinner book? Keep your record
of things: you'll enjoy it in later years. And you'll have
a nice time this autumn&mdash;your new kinsfolk, your new
friends and old and Boston and Cambridge. If you run

<p>The task of being &quot;German Ambassador to Great

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Arthur W. Page</i><br />
<br />
September 15, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>Yesterday was my German day. When the boy came
up to my room, I told him I had some official calls to make.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-91" id="page2-91"></a>[pg II-91]</span>
&quot;Therefore get out my oldest and worst suit.&quot; He
looked much confused; and when I got up both my worst
and best suits were laid out. Evidently he thought he
must have misunderstood me. I asked your mother if she
was ready to go down to breakfast. &quot;Yes.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Well,
then I'll leave you.&quot; She grunted something and when
we both got down she asked: &quot;What <i>did</i> you say to me
upstairs?&quot; I replied: &quot;I regard the incident as closed.&quot;
She looked a sort of pitying look at me and a minute or
two later asked: &quot;What on earth is the matter with you?
Can't you hear at all?&quot; I replied: &quot;No. Therefore let's
talk.&quot; She gave it up, but looked at me again to make
sure I was all there.</p>

<p>I stopped at the barber shop, badly needing a shave.
The barber got his brush and razor ready. I said: &quot;Cut
my hair.&quot; He didn't talk for a few minutes, evidently
engaged in deep thought.</p>

<p>When I got to my office, a case was brought to me of a
runaway American who was caught trying to send news
to Germany. &quot;Very good,&quot; said I, &quot;now let it be made
evident that it shall appear therefore that his innocence
having been duly established he shall be shot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That since it must be evident that his guilt is genuine
therefore see that he be acquitted and then shot.&quot;</p>

<p>Laughlin and Bell and Stabler were seen in an earnest
conference in the next room for nearly half an hour.</p>

<p>Shoecraft brought me a letter. &quot;This is the most
courteous complaint about the French passport bureau
we have yet had. I thought you'd like to see this lady's
letter. She says she knows you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not answer it, then.&quot;</p>

<p>He went off and conferred with the others.</p>

<p>Hodson spoke of the dog he sold to Frank. &quot;Yes,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-92" id="page2-92"></a>[pg II-92]</span>
said I, &quot;since he was a very nice dog, therefore he was
worthless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir?&quot;</p>

<p>And he went off after looking back at me in a queer way.</p>

<p>The day went on in that fashion. When I came out to
go to lunch, the stairs down led upward and I found myself,
therefore, stepping out of the roof on to the sidewalk&mdash;the
house upside down. Smith looked puzzled. &quot;Home,
Sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Go the other way.&quot; After he had driven two
or three blocks, I told him to turn again and go the other
way&mdash;home!</p>

<p>Your mother said almost as soon as I got into the door&mdash;&quot;What
was the matter with you this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nothing. You forget that I am the German
Ambassador.&quot;</p>

<p>Now this whole narrative is a lie. Nothing in it occurred.
If it were otherwise it wouldn't be German.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR KITTY:</p>

<p>You never had a finer autumnal day in the land of the
free than this day has been in this old kingdom&mdash;fresh
and fair; and so your mother said to herself and me:
&quot;Let's go out to the Laughlins' to lunch,&quot; and we went.
There never was a prettier drive. We found out among
other things that you pleased Mrs. Laughlin very much
by your letter. Her garden changes every week or so,
and it never was lovelier than it is now.&mdash;Then we came
back home and dined alone. Well, since we can't have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-93" id="page2-93"></a>[pg II-93]</span>
you and Chud and Frank, I don't care if we do dine
alone sometimes for some time to come. Your mother's
monstrous good company, and sometimes three is a
crowd. And now is a good time to be alone. London
never was so dull or deserted since I've known it, nor
ever so depressed. The military (land) operations are
not cheerful; the hospitals are all full; I see more wounded
soldiers by far than at any previous time; the Zeppelins
came somewhere to this island every night for a week&mdash;one
of them, on the night of the big raid, was visible from
our square for fifteen or twenty minutes&mdash;in general it is
a dull and depressing time. I have thought that since
you were determined to run off with a young fellow, you
chose a pretty good time to go away. I'm afraid there'll
be no more of what we call &quot;fun&quot; in this town as long
as we stay here.</p>

<p>Worse yet: in spite of the Coalition Government and
everybody's wish to get on smoothly and to do nothing
but to push the war, since Parliament convened there's
been a great row, which doesn't get less. The labour
men give trouble; people blame the politicians: Lloyd
George is saving the country, say some; Lloyd George
ought to be hanged, say others. Down with Northcliffe!
They seem likely to burn him at the stake&mdash;except those
who contend that he has saved the nation. Some maintain
that the cabinet is too big&mdash;twenty-two. More say
that it has no leadership. If you favour conscription,
you are a traitor: if you don't favour it, you are pro-German.
It's the same sort of old quarrel they had before
the war, only it is about more subjects. In fact,
nobody seems very clearly to know what it's about.
Meantime the Government is spending money at a rate
that nobody ever dreamed of before. Three million
pounds a day&mdash;some days five million. The Germans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-94" id="page2-94"></a>[pg II-94]</span>
meantime are taking Russia; the Allies are not taking the
Dardanelles; in France the old deadlock continues. Boston
at its worst must be far more cheerful than this.</p>

<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
London, September 26, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>The suppression of facts about the military situation is
more rigorous than ever since the military facts have become
so discouraging. The volume of pretty well authenticated
news that I used to hear privately has become
sensibly diminished. Rumours that reach me by the back
door, in all sorts of indirect ways, are not fewer, but fewer
of them are credible. There is great confusion, great fear,
very great depression&mdash;far greater, I think, than England
has felt, certainly since the Napoleonic scare and probably
since the threat of the Armada. Nobody, I think, supposes
that England herself will be conquered: confidence
in the navy is supreme. But the fear of a practical defeat
of the Allies on the continent is become general. Russia
may have to pay a huge indemnity, going far to reimburse
Germany for the cost of the war; Belgium may be permanently
held unless Germany receive an indemnity to
evacuate, and her seaports may be held anyhow; the Germans
may reach Constantinople before the Allies, and
Germany may thus hold, when the war ends, an open way
to the East; and France may have to pay a large sum to
regain her northern territory now held by the Germans.
These are not the convictions of men here, but they have
distinctly become the fears; and many men's mind are
beginning to adjust themselves to the possible end of the
war, as a draw, with these results. Of course such an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-95" id="page2-95"></a>[pg II-95]</span>
end would be a real German victory and&mdash;another war as
soon as enough men grow up to fight it.</p>

<p>When the more cheerful part of public opinion, especially
when any member of the Government, affects to
laugh at these fears, the people say: &quot;Well, make known
the facts that you base your hope on. Precisely how
many men have volunteered? Is the voluntary system
a success or has it reached its limit? Precisely what is the
situation in the Dardanelles? Are the allied armies
strong enough to make a big drive to break through the
German line in France? Have they big guns and ammunition
enough? What are the facts about the chance
in the Dardanelles? What have we done with reference
to the Balkan States?&quot; Thus an angry and ominous political
situation is arising. The censorship on war news apparently
becomes severer, and the general fear spreads and
deepens. The air, of course, becomes heavily charged
with such rumours as these: that if the Government continue
its policy of secrecy, Lloyd George will resign, seeing
no hope of a real victory: that, if he do resign, his resignation
will disrupt the Government&mdash;cause a sort of
earthquake; that the Government will probably fall and
Lloyd George will be asked to form another one, since he
is, as the public sees it, the most active and efficient man
in political life; that, if all the Balkan States fail the Allies,
Sir Edward Grey will be reckoned a failure and must
resign; and you even now hear talk of Mr. Balfour's
succeeding him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say what basis there is for these and
other such rumours, but they show the general very serious
depression and dissatisfaction. Of that there is no doubt.
Nor is there any doubt about grave differences in the
Cabinet about conscription nor of grave fear in the public
mind about the action of labour unions in hindering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-96" id="page2-96"></a>[pg II-96]</span>
utmost production of ammunition, nor of the increasing
feeling that the Prime Minister doesn't lead the nation.
Except Lloyd George and the Chancellor of the Exchequer<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" /><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
the Cabinet seems to suffer a sort of paralysis.
Lord Kitchener's speech in the House of Lords, explaining
the military situation, reads like a series of month-old
bulletins and was a great disappointment. Mr. Asquith's
corresponding speech in the House seemed to lack complete
frankness. The nation feels that it is being kept
in the dark, and all the military information that it gets
is discouraging. Sir Edward Grey, as philosophic and
enduring a man as I know, seems much more depressed
than I have ever known him to be; Bryce is very very far
from cheerful; Plunkett<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" /><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, whom also you know, is in the
dumps&mdash;it's hard to find a cheerful or a hopeful man.</p>

<p>The secrecy of official life has become so great and successful
that prophecy of political changes must be mere
guess work. But, unless good news come from the Dardanelles
in particular, I have a feeling that Asquith may
resign&mdash;be forced out by the gradual pressure of public
opinion; that Lloyd George will become Prime Minister,
and that (probably) Sir Edward Grey may resign. Yet
I cannot take the prevailing military discouragement
at its face value. The last half million men and the last
million pounds will decide the contest, and the Allies will
have these. This very depression strengthens the nation's
resolution to a degree that they for the moment forget.
The blockade and the armies in the field will wear Germany
down&mdash;not absolutely conquer her, but wear her
down&mdash;probably in another year.</p>

<p>In the meantime our prestige (if that be the right word),
in British judgment, is gone. As they regard it, we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-97" id="page2-97"></a>[pg II-97]</span>
permitted the Germans to kill our citizens, to carry on a
worldwide underhand propaganda from our country (as
well as in it), for which they have made no apology
and no reparation but only vague assurances for the
future now that their submarine fleet has been almost
destroyed. They think that we are credulous to the
point of simplicity to accept any assurances that Bernstorff
may give&mdash;in a word, that the peace-at-any-price
sentiment so dominates American opinion and the American
Government that we will submit to any indignity
or insult&mdash;that we will learn the Germans' real character
when it is too late to save our honour or dignity.
There is no doubt of the definiteness or depth of this
opinion.</p>

<p>And I am afraid that this feeling will show itself in our
future dealings with this government. The public opinion
of the nation as well as the Government accepts their
blockade as justified as well as necessary. They will not
yield on that point, and they will regard our protests as
really inspired by German influence&mdash;thus far at least:
that the German propaganda has organized and encouraged
the commercial objection in the United States,
and that this propaganda and the peace-at-any-price
sentiment demand a stiff controversy with England to
offset the stiff controversy with Germany; and, after all,
they ask, what does a stiff controversy with the United
States amount to? I had no idea that English opinion
could so quickly become practically indifferent as to what
the United States thinks or does. And as nearly as I can
make it out, there is not a general wish that we should go
to war. The prevalent feeling is not a selfish wish for
military help. In fact they think that, by the making of
munitions, by the taking of loans, and by the sale of food
we can help them more than by military and naval action.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-98" id="page2-98"></a>[pg II-98]</span>
Their feeling is based on their disappointment at our submitting
to what they regard as German dallying with us
and to German insults. They believe that, if we had sent
Bernstorff home when his government made its unsatisfactory
reply to our first <i>Lusitania</i> note, Germany would
at once have &quot;come down&quot;; opportunist Balkan States
would have come to the help of the Allies; Holland and
perhaps the Scandinavian States would have got some consideration
at Berlin for their losses by torpedoes; that
more attention would have been paid by Turkey to our
protest against the wholesale massacre of the Armenians;
and that a better settlement with Japan about Pacific
islands and Pacific influence would have been possible for
the English at the end of the war. Since, they argue,
nobody is now afraid of the United States, her moral influence
is impaired at every capital; and I now frequently
hear the opinion that, if the war lasts another year and
the Germans get less and less use of the United States as
a base of general propaganda in all neutral countries,
especially all American countries, they are likely themselves
to declare war on us as a mere defiance of the whole
world and with the hope of stirring up internal trouble
for our government by the activity of the Germans and
the Irish in the United States, which may hinder munitions
and food and loans to the Allies.</p>

<p>I need not remark that the English judgment of the
Germans is hardly judicial. But they reply to this that
every nation has to learn the real, incredible character of
the Prussian by its own unhappy experience. France had
so to learn it, and England, Russia, and Belgium; and we
(the United States), they say, fail to profit in time by the
experience of these. After the Germans have used us to
the utmost in peace, they will force us into war&mdash;or even
flatly declare war on us when they think they can thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-99" id="page2-99"></a>[pg II-99]</span>
cause more embarrassment to the Allies, and when they
conclude that the time is come to make sure that no great
nation shall emerge from the war with a clear commercial
advantage over the others; and in the meantime they will
prove to the world by playing with us that a democracy
is necessarily pacific and hence (in their view) contemptible.
I felt warranted the other day to remark to Lord
Bryce on the unfairness of much of the English judgment
of us (he is very sad and a good deal depressed). &quot;Yes,&quot;
he said, &quot;I have despaired of one people's ever really
understanding another even when the two are as closely
related and as friendly as the Americans and the English.&quot;</p>

<p>You were kind enough to inquire about my health in
your last note. If I could live up to the popular conception
here of my labours and responsibilities and delicate
duties (which is most flattering and greatly exaggerated),
I should be only a walking shadow of a man. But I am
most inappreciately well. I imagine that in some year
to come, I may enjoy a vacation, but I could not enjoy
it now. Besides since civilization has gone backward
several centuries, I suppose I've gone back with it to a
time when men knew no such thing as a vacation. (Let's
forgive House for his kindly, mistaken solicitude.) The
truth is, I often feel that I do not know myself&mdash;body or
soul, boots or breeches. This experience is making us
all here different from the men we were&mdash;but in just
what respects it is hard to tell. We are not within hearing
of the guns (except the guns that shoot at Zeppelins when
they come); but the war crowds itself in on us sensibly
more and more. There are more wounded soldiers on the
streets and in the parks. More and more families one
knows lose their sons, more and more women their husbands.
Death is so common that it seems a little thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-100" id="page2-100"></a>[pg II-100]</span>
Four persons have come to my house to-day (Sunday) in
the hope that I may find their missing kinsmen, and two
more have appealed to me on the telephone and two
more still have sent me notes. Since I began this letter,
Mrs. Page insisted on my going out on the edge of
the city to see an old friend of many years who has
just lost both his sons and whose prospective son-in-law
is at home wounded. The first thing he said was:
&quot;Tell me, what is America going to do?&quot; As we drove
back, we made a call on a household whose nephew is
&quot;missing.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Can't you possibly help us hear definitely
about him?&quot;</p>

<p>This sort of thing all day every day must have some
effect on any man. Then&mdash;yesterday morning gave
promise of a calm, clear day. I never know what sensational
experience awaits me around the next corner.
Then there was put on my desk the first page of a reputable
weekly paper which was filled with an open letter
to me written by the editor and signed. After the usual
description of my multitudinous and delicate duties, I
was called on to insist that my government should protest
against Zeppelin raids on London because a bomb might
kill me! Humour doesn't bubble much now on this side
the world, for the censor had forbidden the publication of
this open letter lest it should possibly cause American-German
trouble! Then the American correspondents
came in to verify a report that a news agency is said to
have had that I was deluged with threatening letters!&mdash;More
widows, more mothers looking for lost sons!...
Once in a while&mdash;far less often than if I lived in a sane
and normal world&mdash;I get a few hours off and go to a lonely
golf club. Alas! there is seldom anybody there but now
and then a pair of girls and now and then a pair of old
fellows who have played golf for a century. Yet back in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-101" id="page2-101"></a>[pg II-101]</span>
London in the War Office I hear they indulge in disrespectful
hilarity at the poor game I play. Now how do
they know? (You'd better look to your score with
Grayson: the English have spies in America. A major-general
in their spy-service department told Mrs. Page
that they knew all about Archibaldi<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" /><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> before he got on the
ship in New York.)</p>

<p>All this I send you not because it is of the slightest
permanent importance (except the English judgment of us)
but because it will prove, if you need proof, that the world
is gone mad. Everything depends on fighting power and
on nothing else. A victory will save the Government.
Even distinctly hopeful military news will. And English
depression will vanish with a turn of the military tide.
If it had been Bernstorff instead of Dumba&mdash;<i>that</i> would
have affected even the English judgment of us. Tyrrell<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22" /><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
remarked to me&mdash;did I write you? &quot;Think of the freaks
of sheer, blind Luck; a man of considerable ability like
Dumba caught for taking a risk that an idiot would have
avoided, and a fool like Bernstorff escaping!&quot; Then he
added: &quot;I hope Bernstorff will be left. No other human
being could serve the English as well as he is serving
them.&quot; So, you see, even in his depression the Englishman
has some humour left&mdash;e.g., when that old sea dog
Lord Fisher heard that Mr. Balfour was to become First
Lord of the Admiralty, he cried out: &quot;Damn it! he
won't do: Arthur Balfour is too much of a gentleman.&quot;
So John Bull is now, after all, rather pathetic&mdash;depressed
as he has not been depressed for at least a hundred
years. The nobility and the common man are doing their
whole duty, dying on the Bosphorus or in France without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-102" id="page2-102"></a>[pg II-102]</span>
a murmur, or facing an insurrection in India; but the
labour union man and the commercial class are holding
hack and hindering a victory. And there is no great
national leader.</p></div>

<h3>CHRISTMAS IN ENGLAND, 1915</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
To Edward M. House<br />
London, December 7, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>I hear you are stroking down the Tammany tiger&mdash;an
easier job than I have with the British lion. You can
find out exactly who your tiger is, you know the house he
lives in, the liquor he drinks, the company he goes with.
The British lion isn't so easy to find. At times in English
history he has dwelt in Downing Street&mdash;not so now. So
far as our struggle with him is concerned, he's all over the
Kingdom; for he is public opinion. The governing crowd
in usual times and on usual subjects can here overrun
public opinion&mdash;can make it, turn it, down it, dodge it.
But it isn't so now&mdash;as it affects us. Every mother's son
of 'em has made up his mind that Germany must and
shall be starved out, and even Sir Edward's scalp isn't
safe when they suspect that he wishes to be lenient in
that matter. They keep trying to drive him out, on
two counts: (1) he lets goods out of Germany for the
United States &quot;and thereby handicaps the fleet&quot;; and
(2) he failed in the Balkans. Sir Edward is too much of a
gentleman for this business of rough-riding over all neutral
rights and for bribing those Balkan bandits.</p>

<p>I went to see him to-day about the <i>Hocking</i>, etc. He
asked me: &quot;Do <i>you know</i> that the ships of this line are
really owned, in good faith, by Americans?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll answer your question,&quot; said I, &quot;if I may then ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-104" id="page2-104"></a>[pg II-104]</span>
you one. No, I don't know of my own knowledge. Now,
<i>do you know</i> that they are <i>not</i> owned by Americans?&quot;</p>

<p>He had to confess that he, of his own knowledge, didn't
know.</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; I said, &quot;for the relief of us both, I pray you
hurry up your prize court.&quot;</p>

<p>When we'd got done quarrelling about ships and I
started to go, he asked me how I liked Wordsworth's war
poems. &quot;The best of all war poems,&quot; said he, &quot;because
they don't glorify war but have to do with its philosophy.&quot;
Then he told me that some friend of his had just
got out a little volume of these war poems selected from
Wordsworth; &quot;and I'm going to send you a copy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just in time,&quot; said I, &quot;for I have a copy of 'The Life
and Letters of John Hay'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" /><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that I'm sending to you.&quot;</p>

<p>He's coming to dine with me in a night or two: he'll do
anything but discuss our Note with me. And he's the
only member of the Government who, I think, would like
to meet our views; and he can't. To use the language of
Lowell about the campaign of Governor Kent&mdash;these
British are hell-bent on starving the Germans out, and
neutrals have mighty few rights till that job's done.</p>

<p>The worst of it is that the job won't be done for a very
long time. I've been making a sort of systematic round
of the Cabinet to see what these fellows think about things
in general at this stage of the game. Bonar Law (the
Colonies) tells me that the news from the Balkans is
worse than the public or the newspapers know, and that
still worse news will come. Germany will have it all her
own way in that quarter.</p>

<p>&quot;And take Egypt and the canal?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't say <i>that</i>,&quot; he replied. But he showed that
he fears even that.</p>

<p>I could go on with a dozen of 'em; but I sat down to
write you a Christmas letter, and nothing else. The
best news I have for you is not news at all, but I conceive
it to be one of the best hopes of the future. In spite of
Irishmen past, present, and to come; in spite of Germans,
whose fuss will soon be over; in spite of lawyers, who (if
left alone) would bankrupt empires as their clients and
think they'd won a victory; I'm going to leave things
here in a year and a half so that, if wise men wish to lay
a plan for keeping the peace of the world, all they need
to do will be to say first to Uncle Sam: &quot;This fellow or
that must understand that he can't break loose like a
wild beast.&quot; If Uncle Sam agrees (and has a real navy
himself), he'll wink at John Bull, and John will follow
after. You see our blackleg tail-twisters have the whole
thing backward. They say we truckle to the British.
My plan is to lead the British&mdash;not for us to go to them
but to have them come to us. We have three white men
to every two white men in their whole Empire; and, when
peace comes, we'll be fairly started on the road to become
as rich as the war will leave them. There are four clubs
in London which have no other purpose than this; and the
best review<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" /><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in the world exists chiefly for this purpose.
All we need to do is to be courteous (we can do what we
like if we do it courteously). Our manners, our politicians,
and our newspapers are all that keep the English-speaking
white man, under our lead, from ruling the
world, without any treaty or entangling alliance whatsoever.
If, when you went to Berlin to talk to your gentle
and timid friend, the Emperor, about disarmament
before the war&mdash;if about 200 American dreadnaughts and
cruisers, with real grog on 'em, had come over to make a
friendly call, in the North Sea, on the 300 English dreadnaughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-106" id="page2-106"></a>[pg II-106]</span>
and cruisers&mdash;just a friendly call, admirals on
admirals&mdash;the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;God Save
the King&quot;&mdash;and if General Bell, from the Philippines, had
happened in London just when Kitchener happened to
be home from Egypt&mdash;<i>then, there wouldn't have been this
war now</i>. Nothing need have been said&mdash;no treaty, no
alliance, nothing. For then 100 or more British naval
ships would have joined the Panama naval procession
and any possible enemy would have seen that combined
fleet clean across the Pacific.</p>

<p>Now this may all be a mere Christmas fancy&mdash;a mere
yarn about what might have been&mdash;because we wouldn't
have sent ships here in our old mood; the crew would have
missed one Sunday School. But it's <i>this kind</i> of thing
that does the trick. But this means the practice of
courtesy, and we haven't acquired the habit. Two years
or more ago the training ships from Annapolis with the
cadets aboard anchored down the Thames and stayed
several weeks and let the boys loose in England. They
go on such a voyage every two years to some country,
you know. The English didn't know that fact and they
took the visit as a special compliment. Their old admirals
were all greatly pleased, and I hear talk about that yet.
We ought to have two or three of our rear-admirals
here on their fleet now. Symington, of course, is a good
fellow; but he's a mere commander and attach&eacute;&mdash;not an
admiral&mdash;in other words, not any particular compliment
or courtesy to the British Navy. (As soon as the war
began, a Japanese admiral turned up here and he is here
now.) We sent over two army captains as military observers.
The Russians sent a brigadier-general. We
ought to have sent General Wood. You see the difference?
There was no courtesy in our method. It would
be the easiest and prettiest job in the world to swallow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-107" id="page2-107"></a>[pg II-107]</span>
the whole British organization, lock, stock, and barrel&mdash;King,
Primate, Cabinet, Lords, and Commons, feathers
and all, and to make 'em follow our <i>courteous</i> lead anywhere.
The President had them in this mood when the
war started and for a long time after&mdash;till the <i>Lusitania</i>
seemed to be forgotten and till the lawyers began to write
his Notes. He can get 'em back, after the war ends, by
several acts of courtesy&mdash;if we could get into the habit of
doing such things as sending generals and admirals as
compliments to them. The British Empire is ruled by a
wily use of courtesies and decorations. If I had the President
himself to do the correspondence, if I had three or
four fine generals and admirals and a good bishop or
two, a thoroughbred senator or two and now and then a
Supreme Court Justice to come on proper errands and
be engineered here in the right way&mdash;we could do or say
anything we liked and they'd do whatever we'd say. I'd
undertake to underwrite the whole English-speaking world
to keep peace, under our leadership. Instead whereof,
every move we now make is to <i>follow</i> them or to <i>drive</i>
them. The latter is impossible, and the former is unbecoming
to us.</p>

<p>But to return to Christmas.&mdash;I could go on writing for
a week in this off-hand, slap-dash way, saying wise things
flippantly. But Christmas&mdash;that's the thing now. Christmas!
What bloody irony it is on this side the world!
Still there will be many pleasant and touching things
done. An Englishman came in to see me the other day
and asked if I'd send $1,000 to Gerard<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25" /><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to use in making
the English prisoners in Germany as happy as possible
on Christmas Day&mdash;only I must never tell anybody who
did it. A lady came on the same errand&mdash;for the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-108" id="page2-108"></a>[pg II-108]</span>
prisoners in Turkey, and with a less but still a generous
sum. The heroism, the generosity, the endurance and
self-restraint and courtesy of these people would melt a
pyramid to tears. Of course there are yellow dogs among
'em, here and there; but the genuine, thoroughbred
English man or woman is the real thing&mdash;one of the realest
things in this world. So polite are they that not a single
English person has yet mentioned our Note to me&mdash;not
one.</p>

<p>But every one I've met for two days has mentioned
the sending of Von Papen and Boy-Ed<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" /><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> home&mdash;not that
they expect us to get into the war, but because they regard
this action as maintaining our self-respect.</p>

<p>Nor do they neglect other things because of the war.
I went to the annual dinner of the Scottish Corporation
the other night-an organization which for 251 years has
looked after Scotchmen stranded in London; and they
collected $20,000 then and there. There's a good deal
of Christmas in 'em yet. One fellow in a little patriotic
speech said that the Government is spending twenty-five
million dollars a day to whip the Germans.&mdash;&quot;Cheap
work, very cheap work. We can spend twice that if
necessary. Why, gentlemen, we haven't exhausted our
pocket-change yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow I keep getting away from Christmas. It
doesn't stay put. It'll be a memorable one here for its
sorrows and for its grim determination&mdash;an empty chair
at every English table. But nowhere in the world will it
be different except in the small neutral states here and in
the lands on your side the world.</p>

<p>How many Christmases the war may last, nobody's
wise enough to know. That depends absolutely on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-109" id="page2-109"></a>[pg II-109]</span>
Germany. The Allies announced their terms ten months
ago, and nothing has yet happened to make them change
them. That would leave the Germans with Germany and
a secure peace&mdash;no obliteration or any other wild nonsense,
but only a secure peace. Let 'em go back home,
pay for the damage they've done, and then stay there.
I do hope that the actual fighting will be ended by Christmas
of next year. Of course it <i>may</i> end with dramatic
suddenness at any time, this being the only way, perhaps,
for the Kaiser to save his throne. Or it may go on for
two or three years. My guess is that it'll end next year&mdash;a
guess subject to revision, of course, by events that can't
be foreseen.</p>

<p>But as I said before&mdash;to come back to Christmas. Mrs.
Page and I send you and Mrs. House our affectionate good
wishes and the hope that you keep very well and very
happy in your happy, prosperous hemisphere. We do,
I thank you. We haven't been better for years&mdash;never
before so busy, never, I think, so free from care. We get
plenty to eat (such as it is in this tasteless wet zone), at a
high cost, of course; we have comfortable beds and shoes
(we spend all our time in these two things, you know);
we have good company, enough to do (!!), no grievances
nor ailments, no ill-will, no disappointments, a keen
interest in some big things&mdash;all the chips are blue, you
know; we don't feel ready for halos, nor for other uncomfortable
honours; we deserve less than we get and
are content with what the gods send. This, I take it, is
all that Martin<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" /><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> would call a comfortable mood for
Christmas; and we are old enough and tough enough to
have thick armour against trouble. When Worry knocks
at the door, the butler tells him we're not at home.</p>

<p>And I see the most interesting work in the world cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-110" id="page2-110"></a>[pg II-110]</span>
out for me for the next twenty-five or thirty years&mdash;to get
such courtesy into our dealings with these our kinsmen
here, public and private&mdash;as will cause them to follow us
in all the developments of democracy and-in keeping
the peace of the world secure. I can't impress it on you
strongly enough that the English-speaking folk have got
to set the pace and keep this world in order. Nobody
else is equal to the job. In all our dealings with the
British, public and private, we allow it to be assumed
that <i>they</i> lead: they don't. <i>We</i> lead. They'll follow, if
we do really lead and are courteous to them. If we hold
back, the Irishman rears up and says we are surrendering
to the English! Suppose we go ahead and the English
surrender to us, what can your Irishmen do then? Or
your German? The British Navy is a pretty good sort
of dog to have to trot under your wagon. If we are
willing to have ten years of thoughtful good manners, I
tell you Jellicoe will eat out of your hand.</p>

<p>Therefore, cheer up! It's not at all improbable that
Ford<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" /><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and his cargo of cranks, if they get across the ocean,
may strike a German mine in the North Sea. Then
they'll die happy, as martyrs; and the rest of us will live
happy, and it'll be a Merry Christmas for everybody.</p>

<p>Our love to Mrs. House.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR D.P. &amp; Co.</p>

<p>... Now, since we're talking about the war, let
me deliver my opinion and leave the subject. They're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-111" id="page2-111"></a>[pg II-111]</span>
killing one another all right; you needn't have any doubt
about that&mdash;so many thousand every day, whether there's
any battle or not. When there's &quot;nothing to report&quot;
from France, that means the regular 5,000 casualties that
happen every day. There isn't any way of getting rid of
men that has been forgotten or neglected. Women and
children, too, of course, starve in Serbia and Poland and
are massacred in Turkey. England, though she has by
very much the largest army she ever had, has the smallest
of all the big armies and yet I don't know a family that
had men of fighting age which hasn't lost one or more
members. And the worst is to come. But you never
hear a complaint. Poor Mr. Dent<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" /><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, for instance (two
sons dead), says: &quot;It's all right. England must be
saved.&quot;</p>

<p>And this Kingdom alone, as you know, is spending
twenty-five million dollars a day. The big loan placed in
the United States<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" /><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> would last but twenty days! if this
pace of slaughter and of spending go on long enough,
there won't be any men or any money left on this side the
world. Yet there will be both left, of course; for somehow
things never quite go to the ultimate smash that seems to
come. Read the history of the French Revolution. How
did the French nation survive?</p>

<p>It will go on, unless some unexpected dramatic military
event end it, for something like another year at least&mdash;many
say for two years more, and some, three years
more. It'll stop, of course, whenever Germany will propose
terms that the Allies can consider&mdash;or something
near such terms; and it won't stop before. By blockade
pressure and by fighting, the Allies are gradually wearing
the Germans out. We can see here the gradual pressure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-112" id="page2-112"></a>[pg II-112]</span>
of events in that direction. My guess is that they won't
go into a third winter.</p>

<p>Well, dear gentlemen, however you may feel about it,
that's enough for me. My day&mdash;every day&mdash;is divided
into these parts: (1) two to three hours listening to Americans
or their agents here whose cargoes are stopped, to
sorrowing American parents whose boys have run away
and gone into the English Army, to nurses and doctors
and shell makers who wish to go to France, to bereaved
English men and women whose sons are &quot;missing&quot;: can
I have them found in Germany? (2) to answering letters
about these same cheerful subjects; (3) to going over cases
and documents prepared about all these sorts of troubles
and forty other sorts, by the eight or ten secretaries of
the Embassy, and a conference with every one of them;
(4) the reading of two books of telegrams, one incoming,
the other outgoing, and the preparation of a lot of answers;
(5) going to the Foreign Office, not every day but often,
to discuss more troubles there; (6) home to dinner at 8
o'clock&mdash;at home or somewhere else, and there is more
talk about the war or about the political troubles. That
for a regular daily routine for pretty nearly a year and a
half! As I say, if anybody is keeping the war up for my
entertainment, he now has my permission to stop. No
time to read, no time to write, little time to think, little
or no time to see the people you most wish to see, I often
don't know the day of the week or of the month: it's a
sort of life in the trenches, without the immediate physical
danger. Then I have my cabinet meetings, my financial
reports (money we spend for four governments: I had till
recently about a million dollars subject to my check);
then the commission for the relief of Belgium; then the
Ambassadors and Ministers of the other neutral states&mdash;our
task is worse than war!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-113" id="page2-113"></a>[pg II-113]</span>
<p>Well, praise God for sleep. I get from seven to nine
hours a night, unbroken; and I don't take Armageddon
to bed with me.</p>

<p>I don't mind telling <i>you</i> (nobody else) that the more I
see just how great statesmen work and manage great
governments&mdash;the more I see of them at close range&mdash;whether
in Washington or London or Berlin or Vienna or
Constantinople (for these are <i>my</i> Capitals), the more I
admire the methods of the Long Island farmers. Boys, I
swear I could take our crowd and do a better job than
many of these great men do. I have to spend a lot of
time to correct their moves before the other fellow finds
out the mistake. For instance I know I spent $2,000 in
telegrams before I could make the German Government
understand the British military age, and the British
Government understand the German military age, for
exchanging prisoners who had lost two legs or arms or
both eyes; and I've had to send a man to Berlin to get a
financial report from one man on one floor of a building
there and to take it to another man on the floor above.
Just yesterday I was reminded that I had made eighteen
requests for the same information of the British Government,
when the nineteenth request for it came from Washington;
and I have now telegraphed that same thing nineteen
times since the war began. Of course everybody's
worked to death. But something else ails a lot of 'em all
the way from Constantinople to London. Leaving out
common gutter lying (and there's much of it) the sheer
stupidity of governments is amazing. They are all so
human, so mighty human! I wouldn't be a government
for any earthly consideration. I'd rather be a brindled
dog and trot under the wagon.</p>

<p>But it has been an inexpressibly interesting experience
to find all this out for myself. There's a sort of weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-114" id="page2-114"></a>[pg II-114]</span>
satisfaction in feeling that you've seen too much of them
to be fooled by 'em any more. And, although most men
now engaged in this game of government are mere common
mortals with most of the common mortal weaknesses, now
and then a really big man does stumble into the business.
I have my doubts whether a really big man ever deliberately
goes into it. And most of the men who the
crowd for the moment thinks are big men don't really
turn out so. It's a game like bull fighting. The bull
is likely to kill you&mdash;pretty sure to do so if you keep
at the business long enough; but in the meantime you have
some exciting experiences and the applause of the audience.
When you get killed, they forget you&mdash;immediately.
There are two rather big men in this Government,
and you wouldn't guess in three rounds who they are.
But in general the war hasn't so far developed very big
men in any country. Else we are yet too close to them to
recognize their greatness. Joffre seems to have great
stuff in him; and (I assure you) you needn't ever laugh at a
Frenchman again. They are a great people. As for the
British, there was never such a race. It's odd&mdash;I hear that
it happens just now to be the fashion in the United States
to say that the British are not doing their share. There
never was a greater slander. They absolutely hold the
Seven Seas. They have caught about seventy submarines
and some of them are now destroying German ships
in the Baltic Sea. They've sent to France by several
times the largest army that any people ever sent over the
sea. They are financing most of their allies and they
have turned this whole island into gun and shell factories.
They made a great mistake at the Dardanelles and they
are slower than death to change their set methods. But
no family in the land, from charcoal burners to dukes,
hesitates one moment to send its sons into the army.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-115" id="page2-115"></a>[pg II-115]</span>
When the news comes of their death, they never whimper.
When you come right down to hard facts, the courage and
the endurance of the British and the French excel anything
ever before seen on this planet. All the old stories
of bravery from Homer down are outdone every day by
these people. I see these British at close range, full-dress
and undress; and I've got to know a lot of 'em as well as
we can ever come to know anybody after we get grown.
There is simply no end to the silly sides of their character.
But, when the real trial comes, they don't flinch; and (except
the thoroughbred American) there are no such men
in the world.</p>

<p>A seven-foot Kansas lawyer (Kansas all over him) came
to see me yesterday. He came here a month ago on
some legal business. He told me yesterday that he had
always despised Englishmen. He's seen a few with stud-horse
clothes and white spats and monocles on who had
gone through Kansas to shoot in the Rocky Mountains.
He couldn't understand 'em and he didn't like 'em.
&quot;So infernally uppish,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what do you think of 'em now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The very best people in the world,&quot; said he. I think
he has a notion of enlisting!</p>

<p>You're still publishing books, I hear. That's a good
occupation. I'd like to be doing it myself. But I can't
even get time to read 'em now.</p>

<p>But, as you know, nobody's writing anything but war
books&mdash;from Kipling to Hall Caine. Poor Kipling!&mdash;his
boy's dead. I have no doubt of it. I've had all the German
hospitals and prison camps searched for him in vain.
These writing men and women, by the way, are as true
blue and as thoroughbred as any other class. I can never
forget Maurice Hewlett's brave behaviour when he
thought that his flying corps son had been killed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-116" id="page2-116"></a>[pg II-116]</span>
Germans or drowned at sea. He's no prig, but a real man.
And the women are as fine as the men....</p>

<p>To go back to books: Of course nobody can tell what
effect the war will have on the writing of them, nor what
sort of new writers may come up. You may be sure that
everything is stirred to its profoundest depths and will
be stirred still more. Some old stagers will be laid on
the shelf; that's certain. What sort of new ones will
come? I asked H.G. Wells this question. He has
promised to think it out and tell me. He has the power
to guess some things very well. I'll put that question to
Conrad when I next see him.</p>

<p>Does anybody in the United States take the Prime
Minister, Mr. Asquith, to be a great man? His wife is a
brilliant woman; and she has kept a diary ever since he
became Prime Minister; and he now has passed the longest
single term in English history. Mr. Dent thinks he's
the biggest man alive, and Dent has some mighty good
instincts.</p>

<p>Talk about troubles! Think of poor Northcliffe. He
thinks he's saved the nation from its miserable government,
and the government now openly abuses him in
the House of Commons. Northcliffe puts on his brass
knuckles and turns the <i>Times</i> building upside down and
sets all the <i>Daily Mail</i> machine guns going, and has to go
to bed to rest his nerves, while the row spreads and
deepens. The Government keeps hell in the prayer-book
because without it they wouldn't know what to do
with Northcliffe; and Northcliffe is just as sure that he
has saved England as he is sure the Duke of Wellington
did.</p>

<p>To come back to the war. (We always do.) Since
I wrote the first part of this letter, I spent an evening with
a member of the Cabinet and he told me so much bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-117" id="page2-117"></a>[pg II-117]</span>
military news, which they prevent the papers from publishing
or even hearing, that to-night I almost share this
man's opinion that the war will last till 1918. That
isn't impossible. If that happens the offer that I heard
a noble old buck make to a group of ladies the other night
may be accepted. This old codger is about seventy-five,
ruddy and saucy yet. &quot;My dear ladies,&quot; said he, &quot;if
the war goes on and on we shall have no young men left.
A double duty will fall on the old fellows. I shall be
ready, when the need comes, to take four extra wives, and
I daresay there are others of my generation who are as
patriotic as I am.&quot;</p>

<p>All of which is only my long-winded, round-about diplomatic
way of wishing you every one and every one of
yours and all the folk in the office, their assigns, superiors,
dependents, companions in labour&mdash;all, everyone and
sundry, the happiest of Christmases; and when you take
stock of your manifold blessings, don't forget to be thankful
for the Atlantic Ocean. That's the best asset of
safety that we have.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR KITTY:</p>

<p>This is my Christmas letter to you and Chud&mdash;a poor
thing, but the best I have to give you. At least it carries
my love, dear, and my wishes that every Christmas under
your own roof will be happier than the preceding one.
Since your starting point is on the high level of your first
Christmas in your own home&mdash;that's a good wish: isn't it?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-118" id="page2-118"></a>[pg II-118]</span>
<p>I'm beginning to think a good deal of your mother and
me. Here we are left alone by every one of you&mdash;in a
foreign land; and, contrary to all predictions that any of
you would have made about us four or five years ago,
we're faring pretty well, thank you, and not on the edge
of dying of loneliness at all. I tell you, I think we're
pretty brave and hardy.</p>

<p>We're even capable of becoming cocky and saucy to
every one of you. Be careful, then.</p>

<p>You see if you have a war to live with you don't necessarily
need children: you'll have strife enough without
'em. We'll console ourselves with such reflections as
these.</p>

<p>And the truth is&mdash;at least about me&mdash;that there isn't
time to think of what you haven't got. Of course, I'm
working, as always, to soften the relations between these
two governments. So far, in spite of the pretty deep
latent feeling on both sides&mdash;far worse than it ought to be
and far worse than I wish it were&mdash;I'm working all the
time to keep things as smooth as possible. Happily,
nobody can prove it, but I believe it, that there is
now and there has been all along more danger of a
serious misunderstanding than anybody has known.
The Germans have, of course, worked in 1000 ways to
cause misunderstanding between England and the United
States. Then, of course, there has been constant danger
in the English bull-headed insularity which sees nothing
but the Englishman's immediate need, and in the English
slowness. Add to these causes the American ignorance
of war and of European conditions. It has been a God's
mercy for us that we have so far had a man like Sir
Edward Grey in his post. And in my post, while there
might well have been a better man, this much at least has
been lucky&mdash;that I do have a consciousness of English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-119" id="page2-119"></a>[pg II-119]</span>
history and of our common origin and some sense of the
inevitable destiny of the great English-speaking race&mdash;so
that, when we have come to sharp corners in the road,
I have known that whatever happen we must travel in the
right general direction&mdash;have known that no temporary
difference must be allowed to assume a permanent quality.
I have thought several times that we had passed the
worst possible place, and then a still worse one would appear.
It does look now as if we had faced most of the
worst difficulties that can come, but I am not sure what
Congress may do or provoke. If we outlast Congress, we
shall be safe. Now to come through this enormous war
even with no worse feeling than already exists between the
two countries&mdash;that'll be a big thing to have done. But
it's work like the work of the English fleet. Nobody can
prove that Jellicoe has been a great admiral. Yet the fleet
has done the whole job more successfully than if it had
had sea-fights and lost a part of their ships.</p>

<p>Our Note has left a great deal of bad feeling&mdash;suppressed,
but existent. A part of it was inevitable and
(I'd say) even necessary. But we put in a lot of things
that seem to me to be merely disputatious, and we didn't
write it in the best form. It corresponds to what you
once called <i>suburban</i>: do you remember? Not thoroughbred.
But we'll get over even that, especially if the Administration
and the courts continue to bring the Germans
to book who are insulting our dignity and destroying
our property and killing Americans. If we can satisfactorily
settle the <i>Lusitania</i> trouble, the whole outlook
will be very good.</p>

<p>Your mother and I are hearing much interesting political
talk. We dined last night with Mr. Bonar Law.
Sir Edward Carson was there. To-day we lunched with
Lady P.&mdash;the other side, you see. There are fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-120" id="page2-120"></a>[pg II-120]</span>
differences continually arising. They thought a
few weeks ago that they had the Prime Minister's scalp.
He proved too nimble for them. Now one person after another
says to you: &quot;Kitchener doesn't deserve the reverence
the people give him.&quot; More and more folks say he's
hard to work with&mdash;is domineering and selfish. Nobody
seems really to know him; and there are some signs that
there may be a row about him.</p>

<p>We've heard nothing from Harold in quite a little
while. We have, you know, three of our footmen in the
war. Allen was wounded at Loos&mdash;a flesh, bullet-wound.
He's about well now and is soon going back. Leslie is
in the trenches and a postal card came from him the other
day. The third one, Philip, is a prisoner in Germany.
Your mother sent him a lot of things, but we've never
heard whether he received them or not. The general
strain&mdash;military, political, financial&mdash;gets greater. The
streets are darker than ever. The number of wounded
increases rapidly. More houses are turned into hospitals.
The Manchesters', next door, is a hospital now. And
everybody fears worse days are to come. But they have
no nerves, these English. They grit their teeth, but they
go on bravely, enduring everything. We run into experiences
every day that melt you, and the heroic things
we hear outnumber and outdo all the stories in all the
books.</p>

<p>I keep forgetting Xmas, Kitty, and this is my Xmas
letter. You needn't put it in your stocking, but you'd
really better burn it up. It would be the ruination of
the world if my frank comments got loose. It's for you
and Chud only. You may fill your stocking full of the
best wishes you ever received&mdash;enough to fill the polar
bear skin. And I send you both my love.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR Boys: R.W.P., A.W.P., F.C.P.</p>

<p>A Merry Christmas to you! Good cheer, good company,

the Lord only knows) that I'll have to be here another
Christmas; but another after that? Not on your

<p>I think I'm as cheerful and hopeful as I ever was, but
this experience here and the war have caused my general
confidence in the orderly progress of civilization somewhat
to readjust itself. I think that any man who looks
over the world and who knows something of the history
of human society&mdash;I mean any American who really believes
in democracy and in human progress&mdash;is somewhat
saddened to see the exceeding slowness of that progress.
In the early days of our Republic hopeful Americans held
the opinion that the other countries of the world would
follow our example; that is to say, would educate the
people, would give the masses a chance to become real
men, would make their governments and institutions
serve the people, would dispense with kings and gross
privileges and become free. Well, they haven't done it.
France is nominally a republic, but the masses of its
people are far, far backward. Switzerland <i>is</i> a republic,
but a very small one. Denmark is a very free state, in
spite of its monarchical form of government. In South
America they think they have republics, but they haven't
the slightest idea of the real education and freedom of the
people. Practically, therefore, the United States and
the self-governing British colonies are the only really
free countries of much importance in the whole world&mdash;these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-122" id="page2-122"></a>[pg II-122]</span>
and this Kingdom. Our example hasn't been followed.
In Europe, Germany and Russia in particular
have monarchs who are in absolute command. Thus on
both sides the world, so far as government and the danger
of war are concerned, there hasn't been very much real
progress in five hundred years.</p>

<p>This is a little disappointing. And it means, of course,
that we are likely to have periodical earthquakes like this
present one till some radical change come. Republics
have their faults, no doubt. But they have at least this
virtue: that no country where the people really have the
control of their government is likely to start out
deliberately on any war of conquest&mdash;is not likely to run
amuck&mdash;and will not regard its population as mere food
for shell and powder.</p>

<p>Nor do I believe that our example of our government
has, relatively to our strength and wealth and population,
as much influence in the world as we had one hundred
years ago. Our people have no foreign consciousness and
I know that our government knows almost nothing about
European affairs; nor do our people know. As regards
foreign affairs our government lacks proper machinery.
Take this as an illustration: The President wrote vigorous
and proper notes about the <i>Lusitania</i> and took a
firm stand with Germany. Germany has paid no attention
to the <i>Lusitania</i> outrage. Yet (as I understand it)
the people will not run the risk of war&mdash;or the Administration
thinks they will not&mdash;and hence the President
can do nothing to make his threat good. Therefore we
stand in a ridiculous situation; and nobody cares how
many notes we write. I don't know that the President
could have done differently&mdash;unless, before he sent the
<i>Lusitania</i> notes, he had called Congress together and
submitted his notes to Congress. But, as the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-123" id="page2-123"></a>[pg II-123]</span>
stands, the Germans are merely encouraged to blow up
factories and practically to carry on war in the United
States, because they know we can (or will) do nothing.
Mere notes break nobody's skin.</p>

<p>We don't seem to have any machinery to bring any
influence to bear on foreign governments or on foreign
opinion; and, this being so, it is little wonder that the rest
of the world does not follow our republican example.</p>

<p>And this sort of impotence in influence has curious
effects at home. For example, the ship-purchase bill, as
it was at the last session of Congress, was an economic
crime. See what has happened: We have waked up to
the fact that we must have a big navy. Well, a navy is
of no far-fighting value unless we have auxiliary ships and
a lot of 'em. Admiral Jellicoe has 3,000 ships under his
command; and he couldn't keep his fleet on the job if
he didn't have them. Most of them are commandeered
merchant, passenger, and fishing ships. Now we haven't
merchant, passenger, and fishing ships to commandeer.
We've got to build and buy auxiliary ships to our navy.
This, to my mind, makes the new ship-purchase bill, or
something like it, necessary. Else our navy, when it
comes to the scratch, will be of no fighting value, however
big it be. It's the price we've got to pay for not having
built up a merchant marine. And we haven't built up a
merchant marine because we've had no foreign consciousness.
While our Irishmen have been leading us to twist
the Lion's tail, we've been depending almost wholly on
English ships&mdash;and, in late years, on German ships. You
can't cross the ocean yet in a decent American ship. You
see, we've declared our independence; and, so far as
individual development goes, we've worked it out. But
the governmental machinery for maintaining it and for
making it visible to the world&mdash;we've simply neglected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-124" id="page2-124"></a>[pg II-124]</span>
build it or to shape it. Hence the President's notes hurt
nobody and accomplish nothing; nor could our navy put
up a real fight, for lack of colliers and supply ships. It's
the same way all around the horizon. And these are the
reasons we haven't made our democracy impress the
world more.</p>

<p>A democracy is not a quick-trigger war-engine and
can't be made into one. When the quick-trigger engines
get to work, they forget that a democracy does not consider
fighting the first duty of man. You can bend your
energies to peaceful pursuits or you can bend them to
war. It's hard to do both at the same time. The Germans
are the only people who have done both at the same
time; and even they didn't get their navy big enough for
their needs.</p>

<p>When the infernal thing's over&mdash;that'll be a glad day;
and the European world won't really know what it has
cost in men and money and loss of standards till it is
over....</p></div>

<br />
London, Christmas, 1915.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>SIR:</p>

<p>For your first Christmas, I have the honour to send you
my most affectionate greetings; and in wishing you all
good health, I take the liberty humbly to indicate some of
the favours of fortune that I am pleased to think I enjoy
in common with you.</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;I hear with pleasure that you are quite well content
with yourself&mdash;not because of a reasoned conviction
of your own worth, which would be mere vanity and unworthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-125" id="page2-125"></a>[pg II-125]</span>
of you, but by reason of a philosophical disposition.
It is too early for you to bother over problems of
self-improvement&mdash;as for me it is too late; wherefore we
are alike in the calm of our self-content. What others
may think or say about us is a subject of the smallest
concern to us. Therefore they generally speak well of
us; for there is little satisfaction in speaking ill of men
who care nothing for your opinion of them. Then, too,
we are content to be where we happen to be&mdash;a fact that
we did not order in the beginning and need not now
concern ourselves about. Consider the eternal coming
and going of folk. On every road many are travelling
one way and an equal number are travelling the other way.
It is obvious that, if they were all content to remain at
the places whence they set forth, the distribution of the
population would be the same. Why therefore move
hither and yon at the cost of much time and labour and
money, since nothing is accomplished thereby? We
spare ourselves by being content to remain where we are.
We thereby have the more time for reflection. Nor can
we help observing with a smile that all persons who have
good reasons to see us themselves make the necessary
journey after they discover that we remain fixed.</p>

<p>Again, people about us are continually doing this service
and that for some other people&mdash;running errands,
mending fences, bearing messages, building, and tearing
down; and they all demand equal service in return. Thus
a large part of mankind keeps itself in constant motion
like bubbles of water racing around a pool at the foot of a
water-fall&mdash;or like rabbits hurrying into their warrens
and immediately hurrying out again. Whereas, while
these antics amuse and sadden us, we for the most part
remain where we are. Hence our wants are few; they
are generally most courteously supplied without our asking;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-126" id="page2-126"></a>[pg II-126]</span>
or, if we happen to be momentarily forgotten, we
can quickly secure anything in the neighbourhood by a
little judicious squalling. Why, then, should we whirl
as bubbles or scurry as rabbits? Our conquering self-possession
gives a masterful charm to life that the victims
of perpetual locomotion never seem to attain.</p>

<p>You have discovered, and my experience confirms yours,
that a perpetual self-consciousness brings most of the
misery of the world. Men see others who are richer than
they; or more famous, or more fortunate&mdash;so they think;
and they become envious. You have not reached the
period of such empty vanity, and I have long passed it.
Let us, therefore, make our mutual vows not to be disturbed
by the good luck or the good graces of others,
but to continue, instead, to contemplate the contented
cat on the rug and the unenvious sky that hangs over all
alike.</p>

<p>This mood will continue to keep our lives simple. Consider
our diet. Could anything be simpler or better?
We are not even tempted by the poisonous victuals wherewith
mankind destroys itself. The very first sound law
of life is to look to the belly; for it is what goes into a
man that ruins him. By avoiding murderous food, we
may hope to become centenarians. And why not? The
golden streets will not be torn up and we need be in no
indecent haste to travel even on them. The satisfactions
of this life are just beginning for us; and we shall
be wise to endure this world for as long a period as possible.</p>

<p>And sleep is good&mdash;long sleep and often; and your age
and mine permit us to indulge in it without the sneers of
the lark or the cock or the dawn.</p>

<p>I pray you, sir, therefore, accept my homage as the
philosopher that you are and my assurance of that high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-127" id="page2-127"></a>[pg II-127]</span>
esteem indicated by my faithful imitation of your virtues.
I am,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

With the sincerest esteem, and<br />
With the most affectionate good wishes,<br />
Sir,<br />
Your proud,<br />
Humble,<br />

<h3>A PERPLEXED AMBASSADOR</h3>


<p>The beginning of the new year saw no improvement
in German-American relations. Germany
and Austria continued to violate the pledge given by
Bernstorff after the sinking of the <i>Arabic</i>&mdash;if that shifty
statement could be regarded as a &quot;pledge.&quot; On November
7, 1915, the Austrians sank the <i>Ancona</i>, in the Mediterranean,
drowning American citizens under conditions
of particular atrocity, and submarine attacks on merchant
ships, without the &quot;warning&quot; or attempt to save
passengers and crew which Bernstorff had promised, took
place nearly every day. On April 18, 1916, the <i>Sussex</i>
was torpedoed in the English Channel, without warning
and with loss of American life. This caused what seemed
to be a real crisis; President Wilson sent what was practically
an ultimatum to Germany, demanding that it &quot;immediately
declare and effect an abandonment of its present
methods of warfare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels,&quot; declaring that, unless it did so, the
United States would sever diplomatic relations with the
German Empire. In reply, Germany apparently backed
down and gave the promise the President had demanded.
However, it coupled this concession with an expression
of its expectation that the United States would compel
Great Britain to observe international law in the blockade.
As this latter statement might be interpreted as a
qualification of its surrender, the incident hardly ended
satisfactorily.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>I stick on the back of this sheet a letter that Sydney
Brooks wrote from New York (May 1st) to the <i>Daily Mail</i>.
He formulates a question that we have many times asked
ourselves and that, in one way or other, comes into everybody's
mind here. Of course the common fellow in Jonesville
who has given most of his time and energy to earning
a living for his wife and children has no foreign consciousness,
whether his Jonesville be in the United States or in
England or in France or in Zanzibar. The real question
is, <i>Do</i> these fellows in Jonesville make up the United
States? or has there been such a lack of prompt leadership
as to make all the Jonesville people confused? It's hard
for me to judge at this distance just how far the President
has led and just how far he has waited and been pushed
along. Suppose he had stood on the front steps every
morning before breakfast for a month after the <i>Lusitania</i>
went down and had called to the people in the same tone
that he used in his note to Germany&mdash;had sounded a bugle
call&mdash;would we have felt as we now feel? What would
the men in Jonesville have done then? Would they
have got their old guns down from over the doors? Or
do they so want peace and so think that they can have
peace always that they've lost their spine? Have they
really been Bryanized, Fordized, Janeaddamsized, Sundayschooled,
and Chautauquaed into supine creatures
to whom the United States and the ideals of the Fathers
mean nothing? Who think a German is as good as an
Englishman? Who have no particular aims or aspirations
for our country and for democracy? When T.R. was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-130" id="page2-130"></a>[pg II-130]</span>
the White House he surely was an active fellow. He
called us to exercise ourselves every morning. He bawled
&quot;Patriotism&quot; loudly. We surely thought we were awake
during those strenuous years. Were we really awake or
did we only look upon him and his antics as a sort of good
show? All that time Bryan was peace-a-footing and
prince-of-peacing. Now did he really have the minds
of the people or did T.R.?</p>

<p>If we've really gone to sleep and if the United States
stands for nothing but personal comfort and commercialism
to our own people, what a job you and the patriotic
men of your generation have cut out for you!</p>

<p>My own conviction (which I don't set great store by)
is that our isolation and prosperity have not gone so far
in softening us as it seems. They've gone a good way,
no doubt; but I think that even the Jonesville people yet
feel their Americanism. What they need is&mdash;leadership.
Their Congressmen are poor, timid, pork-barrel creatures.
Their governors are in training for the Senate. The Vice-President
reads no official literature of the war, &quot;because
then I might have a conviction about it and that wouldn't
be neutral.&quot; And so on. If the people had a <i>real</i> leadership,
I believe they'd wake up even in Jonesville.</p>

<p>Well, let's let these things go for the moment. How's
the Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33" /><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>? And the Ambassador's mother and
sister? They're nice folks of whom and from whom I
hear far too little. Give 'em my love. I don't want you
to rear a fighting family. But these kids won't and
mustn't grow up peace-cranks&mdash;not that anybody objects
to peace, but I do despise and distrust a crank, a crank
about anything. That's the lesson we've got to learn
from these troubled times. First, let cranks alone&mdash;the
other side of the street is good enough for them. Then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-131" id="page2-131"></a>[pg II-131]</span>
if they persist, I see nothing to do but to kill 'em, and
that's troublesome and inconvenient.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, bless the babies. I can't begin to
tell you how very much I long to see them, to make their
acquaintance, to chuckle 'em and punch 'em and see 'em
laugh, and to see just what sort of kids they be.</p>

<p>I've written you how in my opinion there's no country
in the world fit for a modern gentleman and man-of-character
to live in except (1) the United States and (2) this
island. And this island is chiefly valuable for the breed
of men&mdash;the right stock. They become more valuable to
the world after they go away from home. But the right
blood's here. This island's breed is the best there is. An
Englishman or a Scotchman is the best ancestor in this
world, many as his shortcomings are. Some Englishman
asked me one night in what, I thought, the Englishman
appeared at his best. I said, &quot;As an ancestor to
Americans!&quot; And this is the fundamental reason why we
(two peoples) belong close together. Reasons that flow
from these are such as follows: (1) The race is the sea-mastering
race and the navy-managing race and the ocean-carrying
race; (2) the race is the literary race, (3) the
exploring and settling and colonizing race, (4) the race to
whom fair play appeals, and (5) that insists on individual
development.</p>

<p>Your mother having read these two days 1,734 pages of
memoirs of the Coke family, one of whose members wrote
the great law commentaries, another carried pro-American
votes in Parliament in our Revolutionary times, refused
peerages, defied kings and&mdash;begad! here they are
now, living in the same great house and saying and doing
what they darn please&mdash;we know this generation of 'em!&mdash;well,
your mother having read these two big volumes
about the old ones and told me 175 good stories out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-132" id="page2-132"></a>[pg II-132]</span>
these books, bless her soul! she's gone to sleep in a big chair
on the other side of the table. Well she may, she walked
for two hours this morning over hills and cliffs and through
pine woods and along the beach. I guess I'd better wake
her up and get her to go to bed&mdash;as the properer thing to
do at this time o'night, viz. 11. My golf this afternoon
was too bad to confess. But I must say that a 650 and
a 730 yard hole argues the audacity of some fellow and the
despair of many more. Nature made a lot of obstructions
there and Man made more. It must be seven or eight
miles around that course! It's almost a three hour task
to follow my slow ball around it. I suggested we play
with howitzers instead of clubs. Good night!</p></div>

Royal Bath and East Cliff Hotel,<br />
Bournemouth, May 29, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR D.P. &amp; Co.:</p>

<p>I always have it in mind to write you letters; but there's
no chance in my trenches in London; and, since I have
not been out of London for nearly two years&mdash;since the
war began&mdash;only an occasional half day and a night&mdash;till
now&mdash;naturally I've concocted no letter. I've been down
here a week&mdash;a week of sunshine, praise God&mdash;and people
are not after me every ten minutes, or Governments
either; and my most admirable and efficient staff (now
grown to one hundred people) permit few letters and
telegrams to reach me. There never was a little rest more
grateful. The quiet sea out my window shows no sign of
crawling submarines; and, in general, it's as quiet and
peaceful here as in Garden City itself.</p>

<p>I'm on the home-stretch now in all my thoughts and
plans. Three of my four years are gone, and the fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-133" id="page2-133"></a>[pg II-133]</span>
will quickly pass. That's not only the limit of my leave,
but it's quite enough for me. I shouldn't care to live
through another such experience, if the chance should ever
come to me. It has changed my whole life and my whole
outlook on life; and, perhaps, you'd like to hear some impressions
that it has made upon me.</p>

<p>The first impression&mdash;perhaps the strongest&mdash;is a loss
of permanent interest in Europe, especially all Europe
outside of this Kingdom. I have never had the illusion
that Europe had many things that we needed to learn.
The chief lesson that it has had, in my judgment, is the
lesson of the art of living&mdash;the comforts and the courtesies
of life, the refinements and the pleasures of conversation
and of courteous conduct. The upper classes have this
to teach us; and we need and can learn much from them.
But this seems to me all&mdash;or practically all. What we
care most for are individual character, individual development,
and a fair chance for every human being. Character,
of course, the English have&mdash;immense character,
colossal character. But even they have not the dimmest
conception of what we mean by a fair chance for every
human being&mdash;not the slightest. In one thousand years
they <i>may</i> learn it from us. Now on the continent, the
only important Nation that has any character worth
mentioning is the French. Of course the little nations&mdash;some
of them&mdash;have character, such as Holland, Switzerland,
Sweden, etc. But these are all. The others are
simply rotten. In giving a free chance to every human
creature, we've nothing to learn from anybody. In character,
I bow down to the English and Scotch; I respect
the Frenchman highly and admire his good taste. But,
for our needs and from our point of view, the English can
teach us only two great lessons&mdash;character and the art of
living (if you are rich).</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-134" id="page2-134"></a>[pg II-134]</span>
<p>The idea that we were brought up on, therefore, that
Europe is the home of civilization in general&mdash;nonsense!
It's a periodical slaughter-pen, with all the vices that this
implies. I'd as lief live in the Chicago stock-yards.
There they kill beeves and pigs. Here they kill men and
(incidentally) women and children. I should no more
think of encouraging or being happy over a child of mine
becoming a European of any Nation than I should be
happy over his fall from Grace in any other way.</p>

<p>Our form of government and our scheme of society&mdash;God
knows they need improving&mdash;are yet so immeasurably
superior, as systems, to anything on this side the
world that no comparison need be made.</p>

<p>My first strong impression, then, is not that Europe is
&quot;effete&quot;&mdash;that isn't it. It is medi&aelig;val&mdash;far back toward
the Dark Ages, much of it yet uncivilized, held back by
<i>inertia</i> when not held back by worse things. The caste
system is a constant burden almost as heavy as war itself
and often quite as cruel.</p>

<p>The next impression I have is, that, during the thousand
years that will be required for Europe to attain real (modern)
civilization, wars will come as wars have always
come in the past. The different countries and peoples and
governments will not and cannot learn the lesson of federation
and co&ouml;peration so long as a large mass of their
people have no voice and no knowledge except of their
particular business. Compare the miles of railway in
proportion to population with the same proportion in
the United States&mdash;or the telephones, or the use of
the mails, or of bank checks; or make any other practical
measure you like. Every time, you'll come back to the
discouraging fact that the masses in Europe are driven as
cattle. So long as this is true, of course, they'll be driven
periodically into wars. So many countries, so many races,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-135" id="page2-135"></a>[pg II-135]</span>
so many languages all within so small an area as Europe
positively invite deadly differences. If railroads had
been invented before each people had developed its own
separate language, Europe could somehow have been
coordinated, linked up, federated, made to look at life
somewhat in the same way. As it is, wars will be bred
here periodically for about another thousand years. The
devil of this state of things is that they may not always
be able to keep their wars at home.</p>

<p>For me, then, except England and the smaller exceptions
that I have mentioned, Europe will cut no big
figure in my life. In all the humanities, we are a thousand
years ahead of any people here. So also in the adaptabilities
and the conveniences of life, in its versatilities and
in its enjoyments. Most folk are stolid and sad or dull
on this side of the world. Else how could they take their
kings and silly ceremonies seriously?</p>

<p>Now to more immediate and definite impressions. I
have for a year had the conviction that we ought to get
into the war&mdash;into the economic war&mdash;for the following
among many reasons.</p>

<p>1. That's the only way to shorten it. We could cause
Germany's credit (such as she has) instantly to collapse,
and we could hasten her hard times at home which would
induce a surrender.</p>

<p>2. That's the only way we can have any real or important
influence in adjusting whatever arrangements can
be made to secure peace.</p>

<p>3. That's the best way we can inspire complete respect
for us in the minds of other nations and thereby, perhaps,
save ourselves from some wars in the future.</p>

<p>4. That's the best way we can assert our own character&mdash;our
Americanism, and forever get rid of all kinds of
hyphens.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-136" id="page2-136"></a>[pg II-136]</span>
<p>5. That's the only way we shall ever get a real and
sensible preparedness, which will be of enormous educational
value even if no military use should ever be made
of our preparation.</p>

<p>6. That's the only way American consciousness will
ever get back to the self-sacrificing and patriotic point
of view of the Fathers of the Republic.</p>

<p>7. That's the best way to emancipate ourselves from
cranks.</p>

<p>8. That's the only way we'll ever awaken in our whole
people a foreign consciousness that will enable us to assert
our natural influence in the world&mdash;political, financial,
social, commercial&mdash;the best way to make the rest of the
world our customers and friends and followers.</p>

<p>All the foregoing I have fired at the Great White Chief
for a year by telegraph and by mail; and I have never
fired it anywhere else till now. Be very quiet, then.
No man with whom I have talked or whose writings I
have read seems to me to have an adequate conception
of the colossal changes that the war is bringing and will
bring. Of course, I do not mean to imply that I have any
adequate conception. Nobody can yet grasp it. The
loss of (say) ten million men from production of work or
wares or children; what a changed world that fact alone
will make! The presence in all Europe of (perhaps)
fifteen or twenty million more women than men will upset
the whole balance of society as regards the sexes. The
loss of most of the accumulated capital of Europe and the
vast burdens of debt for the future to pay will change the
financial relations of the whole world. From these two
great losses&mdash;men and money&mdash;God knows the many
kinds of changes that will come. Women are doing and
will continue to do many kinds of work hitherto done by
men.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-137" id="page2-137"></a>[pg II-137]</span>
<p>Of course there are some great gains. Many a flabby
or abject fellow will come out of the war a real man: he'll
be nobody's slave thereafter. The criminal luxury of the
rich will not assert itself again for a time. The unparalleled
addition to the world's heroic deeds will be to
the good of mankind, as the unparalleled suffering has
eclipsed all records. The survivors will be in an heroic
mood for the rest of their lives. In general, life will start
on a new plane and a lot of old stupid habits and old party
quarrels and class prejudices will disappear. To get
Europe going again will call for new resolution and a new
sort of effort. Nobody can yet see what far-reaching
effects it will have on government.</p>

<p>If I could make the English and Scotch over, I could
greatly improve them. I'd cut out the Englishman's
arrogance and key him up to a quicker gait. Lord! he's
a slow beast. But he's worked out the germ and the
beginning of all real freedom, and he has character. He
knows how to conserve and to use wealth. He's a great
John Bull, after all. And as for commanding the sea, for
war or trade, you may properly bow down to him and
pay him homage. The war will, I think, quicken him
up. It will lessen his arrogance&mdash;to <i>us</i>, at least. I think
it will make him stronger and humbler. And, whatever
his virtues and his faults, he's the only Great Power we
can go hand in hand with....</p>

<p>These kinds of things have been going on now nearly
two years, and not till these ten days down here have I
had time or chance or a free mind to think them over;
and now there's nothing in particular to think&mdash;nothing
but just to go on, doing these 40,000 things (and they take
a new turn every day) the best I can, without the slightest
regard to consequences. I've long ago passed the place
where, having acted squarely according to my best judgment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-138" id="page2-138"></a>[pg II-138]</span>
I can afford to pay the slightest attention to what
anybody thinks. I see men thrown on the scrap heap
every day. Many of them deserve it, but a good many
do not. In the abnormal state of mind that everybody
has, there are inevitable innocent misunderstandings,
which are as fatal as criminal mistakes. The diplomatic
service is peculiarly exposed to misunderstandings: and,
take the whole diplomatic service of all nations as shown
up by this great strain, it hasn't stood the test very well.
I haven't the respect for it that I had when I started.
Yet, God knows, I have a keen sympathy for it. I've
seen some of 'em displaced; some of 'em lie down; some
of 'em die.</p>

<p>As I've got closer and closer to big men, as a rule they
shrink up. They are very much like the rest of us&mdash;many
of 'em more so. Human nature is stripped in these
times of most of its disguises, and men have to stand and
be judged as a rule by their real qualities. Among all
the men in high place here, Sir Edward Grey stands out
in my mind bigger, not smaller, than he stood in the
beginning. He's a square, honourable gentleman, if there
is one in this world. And it is he, of course, with whom
I have had all my troubles. It's been a truly great
experience to work and to quarrel with such a man. We've
kept the best friendship&mdash;a constantly ripening one.
There are others like him&mdash;only smaller.</p>

<p>Yet they are all in turn set upon by the press or public
opinion and hounded like criminals. They try (somebody
tries) to drive 'em out of office every once in a while.
If there's anything I'm afraid of, it's the newspapers.
The correspondents are as thick as flies in summer&mdash;all
hunting sensations&mdash;especially the yellow American press.
I play the game with these fellows always squarely, sometimes
I fear indiscreetly. But what is discretion? That's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-139" id="page2-139"></a>[pg II-139]</span>
the hardest question of all. We have regular meetings.
I tell 'em everything I can&mdash;always on the condition that
I'm kept out of the papers. If they'll never mention
me, I'll do everything possible for them. Absolute
silence of the newspapers (as far as I can affect it) is the
first rule of safety. So far as I know, we've done fairly
well; but always in proportion to silence. I don't want
any publicity. I don't want any glory. I don't want
any office. I don't want nothin'&mdash;but to do this job
squarely, to get out of this scrape, to go off somewhere in
the sunshine and to see if I can slip back into my old self
and see the world sane again. Yet I'm immensely proud
that I have had the chance to do some good&mdash;to keep our
record straight&mdash;as far as I can, and to be of what service
I can to these heroic people.</p>

<p>Out of it all, one conviction and one purpose grows and
becomes clearer. The world isn't yet half-organized. In
the United States we've lived in a good deal of a fool's
paradise. The world isn't half so safe a place as we supposed.
Until steamships and telegraphs brought the
nations all close together, of course we could enjoy our
isolation. We can't do so any longer. One mad fool in
Berlin has turned the whole earth topsy-turvy. We'd
forgotten what our forefathers learned&mdash;the deadly dangers
of real monarchs and of castes and classes. There
are a lot of 'em left in the world yet. We've grown rich
and-weak; we've let cranks and old women shape our
ideas. We've let our politicians remain provincial and
ignorant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Memorandum written after attending the service at
St. Paul's in memory of Lord Kitchener</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34" /><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>American Embassy, London.</p>

<p>There were two Kitcheners, as every informed person
knows&mdash;(1) the popular hero and (2) the Cabinet Minister
with whom it was impossible for his associates to get along.
He made his administrative career as an autocrat dealing
with dependent and inferior peoples. This experience
fixed his habits and made it impossible for him to do team
work or to delegate work or even to inform his associates
of what he had done or was doing. While, therefore, his
name raised a great army, he was in many ways a hindrance
in the Cabinet. First one thing and then another
was taken out of his hands&mdash;ordnance, munitions, war
plans. When he went to Gallipoli, some persons predicted
that he would never come back. There was a hot
meeting of the Cabinet at which he was asked to go to
Russia, to make a sort of return visit for the visit that important
Russians had made here, and to link up Russia's
military plans with the plans of the Western Allies. He
is said to have remarked that he was going only because he
had been ordered to go. There was a hope and a feeling
again that he might not come back till after the war.</p>

<p>Now just how much truth there is in all this, one has
to guess; but undoubtedly a good deal. He did much in
raising the army, but his name did more. What an
extraordinary situation! The great hero of the Nation an
impossible man to work with. The Cabinet could not
tell the truth about him: the people would not believe it
and would make the Cabinet suffer. Moreover, such a
row would have given comfort to the enemy. Kitchener,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-141" id="page2-141"></a>[pg II-141]</span>
on his part, could not afford to have an open quarrel.
The only solution was to induce him to go away for a long
time. Both sides saw that. Such thoughts were in
everybody's mind while the impressive funeral service was
said and sung in St. Paul's. The Great Hero, who had
failed, was celebrated of course as a Great Hero&mdash;quite
truly and yet far from true. For him his death came at
a lucky time: his work was done.</p>

<p>There is even a rumour, which I don't for a moment
believe, that he is alive on the Orkney Islands and prefers
to disappear there till the war ends. This is fantastic,
and it was doubtless suggested by the story that
he did disappear for several years while he was a young
officer.</p>

<p>I could not help noticing, when I saw all the Cabinet
together at the Cathedral, how much older many of them
look than they looked two years ago. Sir Edward Grey,
Mr. Asquith, Mr. Balfour, who is really an old man,
Lloyd George&mdash;each of these seems ten years older. And
so does the King. The men in responsible places who are
not broken by the war will be bent. General French,
since his retirement to command of the forces in England,
seems much older. So common is this quick aging that
Lady Jellicoe, who went to Scotland to see her husband
after the big naval battle, wrote to Mrs. Page in a sort of
rhapsody and with evident surprise that the Admiral
really did not seem older! The weight of this thing is so
prodigious that it is changing all men who have to do with
it. Men and women (who do not wear mourning) mention
the death of their sons in a way that a stranger might
mistake for indifference. And it has a curious effect on
marriages. Apparently every young fellow who gets a
week's leave from the trenches comes home and marries
and, of course, goes straight back&mdash;especially the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-142" id="page2-142"></a>[pg II-142]</span>
officers. You see weddings all day as you pass the favourite
churches; and already the land is full of young widows.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR ED ALDERMAN:</p>

<p>I shall not forget how good you were to take time to
write me a word about the meeting of the Board&mdash;<i>the</i>
Board: there's no other one in that class&mdash;at Hampton<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36" /><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
and I did most heartily appreciate the knowledge that you
all remembered me. Alas! it's a long, long time ago when
we all met&mdash;so long ago that to me it seems a part of a
former incarnation. These three years&mdash;especially these
two years of the war&mdash;have changed my whole outlook on
life and foreshortened all that came before. I know I
shall never link back to many things (and alas! too, to
many people) that once seemed important and surely
were interesting. Life in these trenches (five warring or
quarrelling governments mining and sapping under me
and shooting over me)&mdash;two years of universal ambassadorship
in this hell are enough&mdash;enough I say, even for
a man who doesn't run away from responsibilities or
weary of toil. And God knows how it has changed me
and is changing me: I sometimes wonder, as a merely intellectual
and quite impersonal curiosity.</p>

<p>Strangely enough I keep pretty well&mdash;very well, in fact.
Perhaps I've learned how to live more wisely than I knew
in the old days; perhaps again, I owe it to my old grandfather
who lived (and enjoyed) ninety-four years. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-143" id="page2-143"></a>[pg II-143]</span>
have walked ten miles to-day and I sit down as the clock
strikes eleven (P.M.) to write this letter.</p>

<p>You will recall more clearly than I certain horrible,
catastrophic, universal-ruin passages in Revelation&mdash;monsters
swallowing the universe, blood and fire and clouds
and an eternal crash, rolling ruin enveloping all things&mdash;well,
all that's come. There are, perhaps, ten million men
dead of this war and, perhaps, one hundred million persons
to whom death would be a blessing. Add to these as
many millions more whose views of life are so distorted that
blank idiocy would be a better mental outlook, and you'll
get a hint (and only a hint) of what the continent has
already become&mdash;a bankrupt slaughter-house inhabited
by unmated women. We have talked of &quot;problems&quot; in
our day. We never had a problem; for the worst task we
ever saw was a mere blithe pastime compared with what
these women and the few men that will remain here must
face. The hills about Verdun are not blown to pieces
worse than the whole social structure and intellectual and
spiritual life of Europe. I wonder that anybody is sane.</p>

<p>Now we have swung into a period and a state of mind
wherein all this seems normal. A lady said to me at a
dinner party (think of a dinner party at all!), &quot;Oh, how
I shall miss the war when it ends! Life without it will
surely be dull and tame. What can we talk about?
Will the old subjects ever interest us again?&quot; I said,
&quot;Let's you and me try and see.&quot; So we talked about
books&mdash;not war books&mdash;old country houses that we both
knew, gardens and gold and what not; and in fifteen
minutes we swung back to the war before we were aware.</p>

<p>I get out of it, as the days rush by, certain fundamental
convictions, which seem to me not only true&mdash;true beyond
any possible cavil&mdash;truer than any other political things
are true&mdash;and far more important than any other contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-144" id="page2-144"></a>[pg II-144]</span>
facts whatsoever in any branch of endeavour,
but better worth while than anything else that men now
living may try to further:</p>

<p>1. The cure for democracy is more democracy. The
danger to the world lies in autocrats and autocracies and
privileged classes; and these things have everywhere been
dangerous and always will be. There's no security in
any part of the world where people cannot think of a
government without a king, and there never will be. You
cannot conceive of a democracy that will unprovoked set
out on a career of conquest. If all our religious missionary
zeal and cash could be turned into convincing
Europe of this simple and obvious fact, the longest step
would be taken for human advancement that has been
taken since 1776. If Carnegie, or, after he is gone, his
Peace People could see this, his Trust might possibly do
some good.</p>

<p>2. As the world stands, the United States and Great
Britain must work together and stand together to keep
the predatory nations in order. A League to Enforce
Peace and the President's idea of disentangling alliances
are all in the right direction, but vague and general and
cumbersome, a sort of bastard children of Neutrality.
<i>The</i> thing, the <i>only</i> thing is&mdash;a perfect understanding
between the English-speaking peoples. That's necessary,
and that's all that's necessary. We must boldly take the
lead in that. I frankly tell my friends here that the
English have got to throw away their damned arrogance
and their insularity and that we Americans have got to
throw away our provincial ignorance (&quot;What is abroad
to us?&quot;), hang our Irish agitators and shoot our hyphenates
and bring up our children with reverence for English
history and in the awe of English literature. This is the
only job now in the world worth the whole zeal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-145" id="page2-145"></a>[pg II-145]</span>
energy of all first-class, thoroughbred English-speaking
men. <i>We</i> must lead. We are natural leaders. The
English must be driven to lead. Item: We must get
their lads into our universities, ours into theirs. They
don't know how to do it, except the little driblet of
Rhodes men. Think this out, remembering what fools
we've been about exchange professors with Germany!
How much good could Fons Smith<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37" /><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> do in a thousand
years, on such an errand as he went on to Berlin? And
the English don't know <i>how</i> to do it. They are childish
(in some things) beyond belief. An Oxford or Cambridge
man never thinks of going back to his university except
about twice a lifetime when his college formally asks him
to come and dine. Then he dines as docilely as a scared
Freshman. I am a D.C.L. of Oxford. I know a lot of
their faculty. They are hospitality itself. But I've
never yet found out one important fact about the university.
They never tell me. I've been down at Cambridge
time and again and stayed with the Master of one
of the colleges. I can no more get at what they do and
how they do it than I could get at the real meaning of a
service in a Buddhist Temple. I have spent a good deal
of time with Lord Rayleigh, who is the Chancellor of
Cambridge University. He never goes there. If he were
to enter the town, all the men in the university would
have to stop their work, get on their parade-day gowns,
line-up by precedent and rank and go to meet him and go
through days of ceremony and incantations. I think the
old man has been there once in five years. Now this
medi&aelig;valism must go&mdash;or be modified. You fellers who
have universities must work a real alliance&mdash;a big job
here. But to go on.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-146" id="page2-146"></a>[pg II-146]</span>
<p>The best informed English opinion is ripe for a complete
working understanding with us. We've got to
work up our end&mdash;get rid of our ignorance of foreign
affairs, our shirt-sleeve, complaining kind of diplomacy,
our sport of twisting the lion's tail and such things and
fall to and bring the English out. It's the <i>one</i> race in
this world that's got the guts.</p>

<p>Hear this in confirmation: I suppose 1,000 English
women have been to see me&mdash;as a last hope&mdash;to ask me to
have inquiries made in Germany about their &quot;missing&quot;
sons or husbands, generally sons. They are of every
class and rank and kind, from marchioness to scrubwoman.
Every one tells her story with the same dignity
of grief, the same marvellous self-restraint, the same
courtesy and deference and sorrowful pride. Not one
has whimpered&mdash;but one. And it turned out that she was
a Belgian. It's the breed. Spartan mothers were theatrical
and pinchbeck compared to these women.</p>

<p>I know a lady of title, very well to do, who for a year
got up at 5:30 and drove herself in her own automobile
from her home in London to Woolwich where she worked
all day long in a shell factory as a volunteer and got home
at 8 o'clock at night. At the end of a year they wanted
her to work in a London place where they keep the records
of the Woolwich work. &quot;Think of it,&quot; said she, as she
shook her enormous diamond ear-rings as I sat next to
her at dinner one Sunday night not long ago, &quot;think of
it&mdash;what an easy time I now have. I don't have to
start till half-past seven and I get home at half-past
six!&quot;</p>

<p>I could fill forty pages with stories like these. This
very Sunday I went to see a bedridden old lady who
sent me word that she had something to tell me. Here
it was: An English flying man's machine got out of order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-147" id="page2-147"></a>[pg II-147]</span>
and he had to descend in German territory. The Germans
captured him and his machine. They ordered him
to take two of their flying men in his machine to show
them a particular place in the English lines. He declined.
&quot;Very well, we'll shoot you, then.&quot; At last he
consented. The three started. The Englishman quietly
strapped himself in. There were no straps for the two
Germans. The Englishman looped-the-loop. The Germans
fell out. The Englishman flew back home. &quot;My
son has been to see me from France. He told me that.
He knows the man&quot;&mdash;thus said the old lady and thanked
me for coming to hear it! She didn't know that the
story has been printed.</p>

<p>But the real question is, &quot;How are you?&quot; Do you
keep strong? Able, without weariness, to keep up your
good work? I heartily hope so, old man. Take good
care of yourself&mdash;very.</p>

<p>My love to Mrs. Alderman. Please don't quote me&mdash;yet.
I have to be very silent publicly about everything.
After March 4th, I shall again be free.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX" />CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>WASHINGTON IN THE SUMMER OF 1916</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>In July Page received a cablegram summoning him to
Washington. This message did not explain why his
presence was desired, nor on this point was Page ever
definitely enlightened, though there were more or less
vague statements that a &quot;change of atmosphere&quot; might
better enable the Ambassador to understand the problems
which were then engrossing the State Department.</p>

<p>The President had now only a single aim in view. From
the date of the so-called <i>Sussex</i> &quot;pledge,&quot; May 4, 1916,
until the resumption of submarine warfare on February 1,
1917, Mr. Wilson devoted all his energies to bringing the
warring powers together and establishing peace. More
than one motive was inspiring the president in this determination.
That this policy accorded with his own
idealistic tendencies is true, and that he aspired to a
position in history as the great &quot;peace maker&quot; is probably
the fact, but he had also more immediate and practical
purposes in mind. Above all, Mr. Wilson was bent on
keeping the United States out of the war; he knew that
there was only one certain way of preserving peace in
this country, and that was by bringing the war itself to
an end. &quot;An early peace is all that can prevent the Germans
from driving us at last into the war,&quot; Page wrote
at about this time; and this single sentence gives the key
to the President's activities for the succeeding nine
months. The negotiations over the <i>Sussex</i> had taught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-149" id="page2-149"></a>[pg II-149]</span>
Mr. Wilson this truth. He understood that the pledge
which the German Government had made was only a
conditional one; that the submarine campaign had been
suspended only for the purpose of giving the United
States a breathing spell during which it could persuade
Great Britain and France to make peace.</p>

<p>&quot;I repeat my proposal,&quot; Bernstorff cabled his government
on April 26,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38" /><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> &quot;to suspend the submarine war at
least for the period of negotiations. This would remove
all danger of a breach [with the United States] and also
enable Wilson to continue his labours in his great plan of
bringing about a peace based upon the freedom of the
seas&mdash;i.e., that for the future trade shall be free from all
interference in time of war. According to the assurances
which Wilson, through House, has given me, he would in
that case take in hand measures directly against England.
He is, however, of the opinion that it would be easier to
bring about peace than to cause England to abandon the
blockade. This last could only be brought about by
war and it is well known that the means of war are lacking
here. A prohibition of exports as a weapon against
the blockade is not possible as the prevailing prosperity
would suffer by it.</p>

<p>&quot;The inquiries made by House have led Wilson to believe
that our enemies would not be unwilling to consider
peace. In view of the present condition of affairs, I
repeat that there is only one possible course, namely,
that Your Excellency [Von Jagow] empower me to declare
that we will enter into negotiations with the United
States touching the conduct of the submarine war while
the negotiations are proceeding. This would give us
the advantage that the submarine war, being over Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-150" id="page2-150"></a>[pg II-150]</span>
Wilson's head, like the sword of Damocles, would compel
him at once to take in hand the task of mediation.&quot;</p>

<p>This dispatch seems sufficiently to explain all the
happenings of the summer and winter of 1916-1917. It
was sent to Berlin on April 26th; the German Government
gave the <i>Sussex</i> &quot;pledge&quot; on May 4th, eight days afterward.
In this reply Germany declared that she would now expect
Mr. Wilson to bring pressure upon Great Britain
to secure a mitigation or suspension of the British blockade,
and to this Mr. Wilson promptly and energetically
replied that he regarded the German promise as an unconditional
one and that the Government of the United
States &quot;cannot for a moment entertain, much less discuss,
a suggestion that respect by German naval authorities
for the rights of citizens of the United States upon
the high seas should in any way or in the slightest degree
be made contingent upon the conduct of any other government
affecting the rights of neutrals and non-combatants.
Responsibility in such matters is single not joint;
absolute not relative.&quot;</p>

<p>This reply gave satisfaction to both the United States
and the countries of the Allies, and Page himself regarded
it as a master stroke. &quot;The more I think of it,&quot; he wrote
on May 17th, &quot;the better the strategy of the President
appears, in his latest (and last) note to Germany. They
laid a trap for him and he caught them in their own trap.
The Germans had tried to 'put it up' to the President to
commit the first unfriendly act. He now 'puts it up' to
them. And this is at last bound to end the controversy
if they sink another ship unlawfully. The French see
this clearly and so do the best English, and it has produced
a most favourable impression. The future? The
German angling for peace will prove futile. They'll have
another fit of fury. Whether they will again become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-151" id="page2-151"></a>[pg II-151]</span>
reckless or commit 'mistakes' with their submarines will
depend partly on their fury, partly on their fear to make
a breach with the United States, but mainly on the state
of their submarine fleet. How many have the English
caught and destroyed? That's the main question, after
all. The English view may not be fair to them. But
nobody here believes that they will long abstain from the
luxury of crime.&quot;</p>

<p>It is thus apparent that when the Germans practically
demanded, as a price of their abstention from indiscriminate
submarine warfare, that Mr. Wilson should
move against Great Britain in the matter of the blockade,
they realized the futility of any such step, and that what
they really expected to obtain was the presidential
mediation for peace. President Wilson at once began to
move in this direction. On May 27th, three weeks after
the Sussex &quot;pledge,&quot; he made an address in Washington
before the League to Enforce Peace, which was intended to
lay the basis for his approaching negotiations. It was in
this speech that he made the statement that the United
States was &quot;not concerned with the causes and the objects&quot;
of the war. &quot;The obscure fountains from which
its stupendous flood has burst forth we are not interested
to search for or to explain.&quot; This was another of those
unfortunate sentences which made the President such an
unsympathetic figure in the estimation of the Allies and
seemed to indicate to them that he had no appreciation
of the nature of the struggle. Though this attitude of
non-partisanship, of equal balance between the accusations
of the Allies and Germany, was intended to make
the President acceptable as a mediator, the practical result
was exactly the reverse, for Allied statesmen turned
from Wilson as soon as those sentences appeared in print.
The fact that this same oration specified the &quot;freedom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-152" id="page2-152"></a>[pg II-152]</span>
the seas&quot; as one of the foundation rocks of the proposed
new settlement only accentuated this unfavourable attitude.</p>

<p>This then was clearly the &quot;atmosphere&quot; which prevailed
in Washington at the time that Page was summoned
home. But Page's letters of this period indicate
how little sympathy he entertained for such negotiations.
&quot;It is quite apparent,&quot; he had recently written to Colonel
House, &quot;that nobody in Washington understands the
war. Come over and find out.&quot; Extracts from a letter
which he wrote to his brother, Mr. Henry A. Page, of
Aberdeen, North Carolina, are especially interesting when
placed side by side with the President's statements of
this particular time. These passages show that a two
years' close observation of the Prussians in action had not
changed Page's opinion of their motives or of their
methods; in 1916, as in 1914, Page could see in this
struggle nothing but a colossal buccaneering expedition
on the part of Germany. &quot;As I look at it,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;our dilly-dallying is likely to get us into war. The
Germans want somebody to rob&mdash;to pay their great
military bills. They've robbed Belgium and are still
robbing it of every penny they can lay their hands
on. They robbed Poland and Serbia&mdash;two very poor
countries which didn't have much. They set out to
rob France and have so far been stopped from getting
to Paris. If they got to Paris there wouldn't be
thirty cents' worth of movable property there in a week,
and they'd levy fines of millions of francs a day. Their
military scheme and teaching and open purpose is to make
somebody pay for their vast military outlay of the last
forty years. They must do that or go bankrupt. Now it
looks as if they would go bankrupt. But in a little while
they may be able to bombard New York and demand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-153" id="page2-153"></a>[pg II-153]</span>
billions of dollars to refrain from destroying the city.
That's the richest place left to spoil.</p>

<p>&quot;Now they say that&mdash;quite openly and quite frankly.
Now if we keep 'neutral' to a highwayman&mdash;what do we
get for our pains? That's the mistake we are making.
If we had sent Bernstorff home the day after the <i>Lusitania</i>
was sunk and recalled Gerard and begun to train an army
we'd have had no more trouble with them. But since
they have found out that they can keep us discussing
things forever and a day, they will keep us discussing
things till they are ready. We are very simple; and we'll
get shot for it yet....</p>

<p>&quot;The prestige and fear of the United States has gone
down, down, down-disappeared; and we are regarded as
'discussors,' incapable of action, scared to death of war.
That's all the invitation that robbers, whose chief business
is war, want&mdash;all the invitation they need. These
devils are out for robbery&mdash;and you don't seem to believe
it in the United States: that's the queer thing. This
neutrality business makes us an easy mark. As soon as
they took a town in Belgium, they asked for all the money
in the town, all the food, all the movable property; and
they've levied a tax every month since on every town and
made the town government borrow the money to pay it.
If a child in a town makes a disrespectful remark, they fine
the town an extra $1,000. They haven't got enough so
far to keep them going flush; and they won't unless they
get Paris&mdash;which they can't do now. If they got London,
they'd be rich; they wouldn't leave a shilling and they'd
make all the rich English get all the money they own
abroad. This is the reason that Frenchmen and Englishmen
prefer to be killed by the 100,000. In the country
over which their army has passed a crow would die of
starvation and no human being has ten cents of real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-154" id="page2-154"></a>[pg II-154]</span>
money. The Belgian Commission is spending more than
100 million dollars a year to keep the Belgians alive&mdash;only
because they are robbed every day. They have a rich
country and could support themselves but for these robbers.
That's the meaning of the whole thing. And yet
we treat them as if they were honourable people. It's
only a question of time and of power when they will attack
us, or the Canal, or South America. Everybody on this
side the world knows that. And they are 'yielding' to
keep us out of this war so that England will not
help us when they (the Germans) get ready to attack
America.</p>

<p>&quot;There is the strangest infatuation in the United States
with Peace&mdash;the strangest illusion about our safety without
preparation.&quot;</p>

<p>Several letters to Colonel House show the state of the
British mind on the subject of the President's peace proposals:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
Royal Bath and East Cliff Hotel,<br />
Bournemouth,<br />
23 May, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>The motor trip that the Houses, the Wallaces, and the
Pages took about a year ago was the last trip (three days)
that I had had out of London; and I'd got pretty tired.
The <i>China</i> case having been settled (and settled as we
wanted it), I thought it a good time to try to get away
for a week. So here Mrs. Page and I are&mdash;very much to
my benefit. I've spent a beautiful week out of doors, on
this seashore; and I have only about ten per cent. of the
fatal diseases that I had a week ago. That is to say, I'm
as sound as a dollar and feel like a fighting cock.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-155" id="page2-155"></a>[pg II-155]</span>
<p>Sir Edward was fine about the China<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39" /><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> case. He never
disputed the principle of the inviolability of American
ships on the high seas; but the Admiralty maintained that
some of these men are officers in the German Army and
are now receiving officers' pay. I think that that is probably
true. Nevertheless, the Admiralty had bungled the
case badly and Sir Edward simply rode over them. They
have a fine quarrel among themselves and we got all we
wanted and asked for.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't make out the Germans but I am afraid
some huge deviltry is yet coming. When the English
say that the Germans must give up their militarism, I
doubt if the Germans yet know what they mean. They
talk about conquered territory&mdash;Belgium, Poland, and the
rest. It hasn't entered their heads that they've got to
give up their armies and their military system. When
this does get into their heads, if it ever do, I think they
may so swell with rage at this &quot;insult&quot; that they may
break loose in one last desperate effort, ignoring the United
States, defying the universe, running amuck. Of course it
would be foolhardy to predict this, but the fear of it keeps
coming into my mind. The fear is the more persistent
because, if the worst comes to them, the military caste and
perhaps the dynasty itself will prefer to die in one last terrific
onslaught rather than to make a peace on terms which
will require the practical extinction of their supreme power.
This, I conceive, is the really great danger that yet awaits
the world&mdash;if the Allies hold together till defeat and
famine drive the Germans to the utmost desperation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Allies still holding together as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-156" id="page2-156"></a>[pg II-156]</span>
they are, there's no peace yet in the British and French
minds. They're after the militarism of Prussia&mdash;not
territory or other gains; and they seem likely to get it,
as much by the blockade as by victories on land. Do
you remember how in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck
refused to deal with the French Emperor? He demanded
that representatives of the French people should deal with
him. He got what he asked for and that was the last of
the French Emperor. Neither the French nor the English
have forgotten that. You will recall that the Germans
starved Paris into submission. Neither the French
nor the English have forgotten that. These two leaves out
of the Germans' own book of forty-five years ago&mdash;these
two and no more&mdash;<i>may</i> be forced on the Germans themselves.
They are both quite legitimate, too. You can
read a recollection of both these events between the lines
of the interviews that Sir Edward and Mr. Balfour recently
gave to American newspapers.</p>

<p>There is nothing but admiration here for the strategy
of the President's last note to Germany. That was the
cleverest play made by anybody since the war began&mdash;clever
beyond praise. Now he's &quot;got 'em.&quot; But nobody
here doubts that they will say, sooner or later, that the
United States, not having forced the breaking of the
British blockade, has not kept its bargain&mdash;that's what
they'll say&mdash;and it is in order again to run amuck. This
is what the English think&mdash;provided the Germans have
enough submarines left to keep up real damage. By that
time, too, it will be clear to the Germans that the President
can't bring peace so long as only one side wishes peace.
The Germans seem to have counted much on the Irish
uprising, which came to pass at all only because of the
customary English stupid bungling; and the net result has
been only to put the mass of the Irish on their mettle to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-157" id="page2-157"></a>[pg II-157]</span>
show that they are not Sinn Feiners. The final upshot
will be to strengthen the British Army. God surely is
good to this bungling British Government. Wind and
wave and the will of High Heaven seem to work for them.
I begin to understand their stupidity and their arrogance.
If your enemies are such fools in psychological tactics and
Heaven is with you, why take the trouble to be alert?
And why be modest? Whatever the reason, these English
are now more cocky and confident than they've been
before since the war began. They are beginning to see
results. The only question seems to be to hold the Allies
together, and they seem to be doing that. In fact, the
battle of Verdun has cemented them. They now have
visible proof that the German Army is on the wane. And
they have trustworthy evidence that the blockade is telling
severely on the Germans. Nobody, I think, expects
to thrash 'em to a frazzle; but the almost universal opinion
here is that the hold of militarism will be shaken loose.
And the German High Canal Navy&mdash;what's to become
of that? Von Tirpitz is down and out, but there are
thousands of Germans, I hear, who complain of their
naval inactivity. But God only knows the future&mdash;I
don't. I think that I do well if I keep track of the
present....</p>

<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
London, 25 May, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>No utterance by anybody has so stirred the people of
this kingdom for many months as Sir Edward Grey's
impromptu speech last night in the House of Commons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-158" id="page2-158"></a>[pg II-158]</span>
about Peace, when he called the German Chancellor a
first-class liar. I sent you to-day a clipping from one of
the morning papers. Every paper I pick up compliments
Sir Edward. Everyone says, &quot;We must fight
to a finish.&quot; The more sensational press intimates that
any Englishman who uses the word &quot;peace&quot; ought
to be shot. You have never seen such a rally as that
which has taken place in response to Sir Edward's cry.
In the first place, as you know, he is the most gentle of all
the Cabinet, the last man to get on a &quot;war-rampage,&quot; the
least belligerent and rambunctious of the whole lot. When
he felt moved to say that there can be no peace till the
German military despotism is broken, everybody from
one end of the Kingdom to the other seems to have thrown
up his hat and applauded. Except the half-dozen peace-cranks
in the House (Bryan sort of men) you can't find
a man, woman, child, or dog that isn't fired with the determination
to see the war through. The continued talk
about peace which is reported directly and indirectly from
Germany&mdash;coming from Switzerland, from Rome, from
Washington&mdash;has made the English and the French very
angry: no, &quot;angry&quot; isn't quite the right word. It has
made them very determined. They feel insulted by the
impudence of the Germans, who, since they know they
are bound to lose, seem to be turning heaven and
earth to induce neutrals to take their view of peace.
People are asking here, &quot;If they are victorious, why
doesn't their fleet come out of the canal and take the seas,
and again open their commerce? Why do they whimper
about the blockade when they will not even risk a warship
to break it?&quot; You'll recall how the talk here used to be
that the English wouldn't wake up. You wouldn't know
'em now. Your bulldog has got his grip and even thunder
doesn't disturb him.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-159" id="page2-159"></a>[pg II-159]</span>
<p>Incidentally, all the old criticism of Sir Edward Grey
seems to have been forgotten. You hear nothing
but praise of him now. I am told that he spoke
his impromptu speech last night with great fire and
at once left the House. His speech has caused a greater
stir than the Irish rebellion, showing that every Englishman
feels that Sir Edward said precisely what every man
feels.</p>

<p>The Germans have apparently overdone and overworked
their premature peace efforts and have made
things worse for them. They've overplayed their
hand.</p>

<p>In fact, I see no end of the war. The Allies are
not going to quit prematurely. They won't even discuss
the subject yet with one another, and the Germans,
by their peace-talk of the sort that they inspire, simply
postpone the day when the Allies will take the subject
up.</p>

<p>All the while, too, the Allies work closer and closer
together. They'll soon be doing even their diplomatic
work with neutrals, as a unit&mdash;England and France as one
nation, and (on great subjects) Russia and Italy also
with them.</p>

<p>I've talked lately not only with Sir Edward but with
nearly half the other members of the Cabinet, and they
are all keyed up to the same tune. The press of both
parties, too, are (for once) wholly agreed: Liberal and
Conservative papers alike hold the same war-creed.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Sincerely yours,<br />
<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>Before leaving for Washington Page discussed the
situation personally with Sir Edward Grey and Lord
Bryce. He has left memoranda of both interviews.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-160" id="page2-160"></a>[pg II-160]</span></div>
<p><i>Notes of a Private and Informal Conversation with
Sir Edward Grey, at his residence, on July 27, 1916, when
I called to say good-bye before sailing on leave to the United
States</i></p>

<p>... Sir Edward Grey went on to say quite
frankly that two thoughts expressed in a speech by the
President some months ago had had a very serious influence
on British opinion. One thought was that the causes
or objects of the war were of no concern to him, and the
other was his (at least implied) endorsement of &quot;the freedom
of the seas,&quot; which the President did not define.
Concerning the first thought, he understood of course
that a neutral President could not say that he favoured
one side or the other: everybody understood that and nobody
expected him to take sides. But when the President
said that the objects of the war did not concern him,
that was taken by British public opinion as meaning a
condemnation of the British cause, and it produced deep
feeling.</p>

<p>Concerning the &quot;freedom of the seas,&quot; he believed that
the first use of the phrase was made by Colonel House
(on his return from one of his visits to Berlin)<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40" /><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, but the
public now regarded it as a German invention and it
meant to the British mind a policy which would render
British supremacy at sea of little value in time of war; and
public opinion resented this. He knew perfectly well that
at a convenient time new rules must be made governing
the conduct of war at sea and on the land, too. But
the German idea of &quot;the freedom of the seas&quot; (&quot;freedom&quot;
was needed on land also) is repulsive to the British
mind.</p>

<p>He mentioned these things because they had produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-161" id="page2-161"></a>[pg II-161]</span>
in many minds an unwillingness, he feared, to use the good
offices of the President whenever any mediatorial service
might be done by a neutral. The tendency of these
remarks was certainly in that direction. Yet Sir Edward
carefully abstained from expressing such an unwillingness
on his own part, and the inference from his tone
and manner, as well as from his habitual attitude, is that
he feels no unwillingness to use the President's good office,
if occasion should arise.</p>

<p>I asked what he meant by &quot;mediatorial&quot;&mdash;the President's
offering his services or good offices on his own
initiative? He said&mdash;No, not that. But the Germans
might express to the President their willingness or even
their definite wish to have an armistice, on certain terms,
to discuss conditions of peace coupled with an intimation
that he might sound the Allies. He did not expect the
President to act on his own initiative, but at the request or
at least at the suggestion of the German Government, he
might conceivably sound the Allies&mdash;especially, he added,
&quot;since I am informed that the notion is wide-spread in
America that the war will end inconclusively&mdash;as a draw.&quot;
He smiled and remarked, as an aside, that he didn't think
that this notion was held by any considerable group of
people in any other country, certainly not in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>In further talk on this subject he said that none of the
Allies could mention peace or discuss peace till France
should express such a wish; for it is the very vitals of
France that have received and are receiving the shock
of such an assault as was never before launched against
any nation. Unless France was ready to quit, none of
France's Allies could mention peace, and France showed
no mood to quit. Least of all could the English make or
receive any such suggestion at least till her new great army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-162" id="page2-162"></a>[pg II-162]</span>
had done its best; for until lately the severest fighting had
not been done by the British, whose army had practically
been held in reserve. There had for a long time been a
perfect understanding between Joffre and Haig&mdash;that the
English would wait to begin their offensive till the moment
arrived when it best suited the French.</p>

<p>The impression that I got from this part of the conversation
was that Sir Edward hoped that I might convey to
the President (as, of course, he could not) Sir Edward's
idea of the effect of these parts of the President's speech on
feeling in England toward him. Nowhere in the conversation
did he make any request of me. Any one, overhearing
it, might have supposed it to be a conversation
between two men, with no object beyond expressing their
views. But, of course, he hoped and meant that I should,
in my own way, make known to the President what he
said. He did not say that the President's good offices,
when the time should come, would be unwelcome to him
or to his government; and he meant, I am sure, to convey
only the fear that by these assertions the President had
planted an objection to his good offices in a large section
of British opinion.</p>

<p>Among the conditions of peace that Sir Edward himself
personally would like to see imposed (he had not yet
discussed the subject with any of his colleagues in the
Government) was this: that the German Government
should agree to submit to an impartial (neutral) commission
or court the question, Who began the war and
who is responsible for it? The German Chancellor and
other high German officials have put it about and continue
to put it about that England is responsible, and doubtless
the German people at least believe it. All the governments
concerned must (this is his idea) submit to the
tribunal all its documents and other evidence bearing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-163" id="page2-163"></a>[pg II-163]</span>
the subject; and of course the finding of the tribunal must
be published.</p>

<p>Then he talked a good deal about the idea that lies behind
the League for Enforcing Peace&mdash;in a sympathetic
mood. He went on to point out how such a league&mdash;with
force behind it&mdash;would at any one of three stages
have prevented this war&mdash;(1) When England proposed
a conference to France, Germany, Italy, and Russia, all
agreed to it but Germany. Germany alone prevented
a discussion. If the League to Enforce Peace had included
England, France, Italy, and Russia&mdash;there would
have been no war; for Germany would have seen at once
that they would all be against her. (2) Later, when the
Czar sent the Kaiser a personal telegram proposing to
submit their differences to some tribunal, a League to
Enforce Peace would have prevented war. And (3) when
the question of the invasion of Belgium came up, every
signatory to the treaty guaranteeing Belgium's integrity
gave assurance of keeping the treaty&mdash;but Germany,
and Germany gave an evasive answer. A league would
again have prevented a war&mdash;or put all the military force
of all its members against Germany.</p>

<p>Throughout the conversation, which lasted about an
hour, Sir Edward said more than once, as he has often said
to me, that he hoped we should be able to keep the friction
between our governments at the minimum. He would
regard it as the greatest calamity if the ill-feeling that
various events have stirred up in sections of public opinion
on each side should increase or should become permanent.
His constant wish and effort were to lessen and if possible
to remove all misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Lord Bryce was one of the Englishmen with whom Page
was especially inclined to discuss pending problems.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-164" id="page2-164"></a>[pg II-164]</span></div>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Notes on a conversation with Lord Bryce,
July 31, 1916</i></p></div>

<p>Lord Bryce spoke of the President's declaration that we
were not concerned with the causes or objects of the war
and he said that that remark had caused much talk&mdash;all,
as he thought, on a misunderstanding of Mr. Wilson's
meaning. &quot;He meant, I take it, only that he did not
propose at that time to discuss the causes or the objects of
the war; and it is a pity that his sentence was capable of
being interpreted to mean something else; and the sentence
was published and discussed here apart from its
context&mdash;a most unfair proceeding. I can imagine that
the President and his friends may be much annoyed by
this improper interpretation.&quot;</p>

<p>I remarked that the body of the speech in which this
remark occurred might have been written in Downing
Street, so friendly was it to the Allies.</p>

<p>&quot;Quite, quite,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>This was at dinner, Lady Bryce and Mrs. Page and he
and I only being present.</p>

<p>When he and I went into the library he talked more
than an hour.</p>

<p>&quot;And what about this blacklist?&quot; he asked. I told
him. He had been in France for a week and did not know
just what had been done. He said that that seemed to
him a mistake. &quot;The Government doesn't know America&mdash;neither
does the British public. Neither does the
American Government (no American government) know
the British. Hence your government writes too many
notes&mdash;all governments are likely to write too many notes.
Everybody gets tired of seeing them and they lose their
effect.&quot;</p>

<p>He mentioned the blockade and said that it had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-165" id="page2-165"></a>[pg II-165]</span>
quite effective&mdash;wonderfully effective, in fact; and he
implied that he did not see why we now failed to recognize
it. Our refusal to recognize it had caused and
doubtless is now causing such ill-feeling as exists in England.</p>

<p>Then he talked long about peace and how it would probably
be arranged. He judged, from letters that he receives
from the United States as well as from Americans
who come over here, that there was an expectation in
America that the President would be called in at the peace
settlement and that some persons even expected him to
offer mediation. He did not see how that could be. He
knew no precedent for such a proceeding. The President
might, of course, on the definite request of either side,
make a definite inquiry of the other side; but such a course
would be, in effect, merely the transmission of an inquiry.</p>

<p>But after peace was made and the time came to set
up a League for Enforcing Peace, or some such machinery,
of course the United States would be and would have
to be a party to that if it were to succeed. He reminded
me that a little group of men here, of whom he was one,
early in the war sketched substantially the same plan
that the American League to Enforce Peace has worked
out. It had not seemed advisable to have any general
public discussion of it in England till the war should end:
nobody had time now to give to it.</p>

<p>As he knew no precedent for belligerents to call in a
third party when they met to end a war, so he knew no
precedent for any outside government to protest against
the invasion of a country by a Power that had signed
a treaty to guarantee the integrity of the invaded country&mdash;no
precedent, that is to say, for the United States to
protest against the invasion of Belgium. &quot;That precedent,&quot;
I said, &quot;was found in Hysteria.&quot;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-166" id="page2-166"></a>[pg II-166]</span></div>
<p>Lord Bryce, who had just returned from a visit to the
British headquarters in France, hardly dared hope for the
end of the war till next year; and the intervening time
between now and the end would be a time, he feared, of
renewed atrocities and increasing hatred. He cited the
killing of Captain Fryatt of the <i>Brussels</i> and the forcible
deportation of young women from Lille and other towns
in the provinces of France occupied by the Germans.</p>

<p>The most definite idea that he had touching American-British
relations was the fear that the anti-British feeling
in the United States would become stronger and would
outlast the war. &quot;It is organized,&quot; he said. &quot;The disaffected
Germans and the disaffected Irish are interested
in keeping it up.&quot; He asked what effect I thought the
Presidential campaign would have on this feeling. He
seemed to have a fear that somehow the campaign would
give an occasion for stirring it up even more.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye. Give my regards to all my American
friends; and I'm proud to say there are a good many of
them.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One episode that was greatly stirring both Great Britain
and the United States at this time was the trial of Sir
Roger Casement, the Irish leader who had left Wilhelmshaven
for Ireland in a German submarine and who had
been captured at Tralee in the act of landing arms and
munitions for an Irish insurrection. Casement's subsequent
trial and conviction on a charge of high treason had
inspired a movement in his favour from Irish-Americans,
the final outcome of which was that the Senate, in early
August, passed a resolution asking the British Government
for clemency and stipulating that this resolution
should be presented to the Foreign Office. Page was
then on the ocean bound for the United States and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-167" id="page2-167"></a>[pg II-167]</span>
the delicate task of presenting this document to Sir
Edward Grey fell upon Mr. Laughlin, who was now
Charg&eacute; d'affaires. Mr. Laughlin is a diplomat of great
experience, but this responsibility at first seemed to be
something of a poser even for him. He had received explicit
instructions from Washington to present this resolution,
and the one thing above all which a diplomatic officer
must do is to carry out the orders of his government, but
Mr. Laughlin well knew that, should he present this paper
in the usual manner, the Foreign Secretary might decline
to receive it; he might regard it as an interference with
matters that exclusively concerned the sovereign state.
Mr. Laughlin, however, has a technique all his own, and,
in accordance with this, he asked for an interview with Sir
Edward Grey to discuss a matter of routine business.
However, the Charg&eacute; d'affaires carried the Casement
resolution tucked away in an inside pocket when he made
his call.</p>

<p>Like Mr. Page, Mr. Laughlin was on the friendliest terms
with Sir Edward Grey, and, after the particular piece of
business had been transacted, the two men, as usual, fell
into casual conversation. Casement then loomed large
in the daily press, and the activities of the American Senate
had likewise caused some commotion in London. In
round-about fashion Mr. Laughlin was able to lead Sir
Edward to make some reference to the Casement case.</p>

<p>&quot;I see the Senate has passed a resolution asking clemency,&quot;
said the Foreign Secretary&mdash;exactly the remark
which the American wished to elicit.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was the reply. &quot;By the way, I happen to have
a copy of the resolution with me. May I give it to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I should like to have it.&quot;</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary read it over with deliberation.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a very interesting document,&quot; he said, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-168" id="page2-168"></a>[pg II-168]</span>
had finished. &quot;Would you have any objection if I
showed it to the Prime Minister?&quot;</p>

<p>Of course that was precisely what Mr. Laughlin did wish,
and he replied that this was the desire of his government.
The purpose of his visit had been accomplished, and he
was able to cable Washington that its instructions had
been carried out and that the Casement resolution had
been presented to the British Government. Simultaneously
with his communication, however, he reported also
that the execution of Roger Casement had taken place.
In fact, it was being carried out at the time of the interview.
This incident lends point to Page's memorandum of the
last interview which he had before leaving England.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>August 1st. I lunched with Mr. Asquith. One does
not usually bring away much from his conversations, and
he did not say much to-day worth recording. But he
showed a very eager interest in the Presidential campaign,
and he confessed that he felt some anxiety about the anti-British
feeling in the United States. This led him to tell
me that he could not in good conscience interfere with
Casement's execution, in spite of the shoals of telegrams
that he was receiving from the United States. This man,
said he, visited Irish prisoners in German camps and tried
to seduce them to take up arms against Great Britain&mdash;their
own country. When they refused, the Germans
removed them to the worst places in their Empire and, as a
result, some of them died. Then Casement came to Ireland
in a German man-of-war (a submarine) accompanied by
a ship loaded with guns. &quot;In all good conscience to my
country and to my responsibilities I cannot interfere.&quot; He
hoped that thoughtful opinion in the United States would
see this whole matter in a fair and just way.</p>

<p>I asked him about anti-American feeling in Great Britain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-169" id="page2-169"></a>[pg II-169]</span>
He said: &quot;Do not let that unduly disturb you. At
bottom we understand you. At bottom the two people
surely understand one another and have unbreakable
bonds of sympathy. No serious breach is conceivable.&quot;
He went on quite earnestly: &quot;Mr. Page, after any policy
or plan is thought out on its merits my next thought always
is how it may affect our relations with the United
States. That is always a fundamental consideration.&quot;</p>

<p>I ventured to say that if he would keep our relations
smooth on the surface, I'd guarantee their stability at the
bottom. It's the surface that rolls high at times, and the
danger is there. Keep the surface smooth and the bottom
will take care of itself.</p>

<p>Then he asked about Mexico, as he usually has when
I have talked with him. I gave him as good a report as I
could, reminding him of the great change in the attitude of
all Latin-America caused by the President's patient policy
with Mexico. When he said, &quot;Mexico is a bad problem,&quot;
I couldn't resist the impulse to reply: &quot;When Mexico
troubles you, think of&mdash;Ireland. As there are persons in
England who concern themselves with Mexico, so there
are persons in the United States who concern themselves
about Ireland. Ireland and Mexico have each given
trouble for two centuries. Yet these people talk about
them as if they could remove all trouble in a month.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite true,&quot; he said, and smiled himself into silence.
Then he talked about more or less frivolous subjects; and,
as always, he asked about Mr. Bryan and Mr. Roosevelt,
&quot;alike now, I suppose, in their present obscure plight.&quot;
I told him I was going from his house to the House of
Lords to see Sir Edward Grey metamorphosed into Viscount
Grey of Fallodon.</p>

<p>&quot;The very stupidest of the many stupid ceremonies that
we have,&quot; said he&mdash;very truly.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-170" id="page2-170"></a>[pg II-170]</span></div>
<p>He spoke of my &quot;onerous duties&quot; and so on and so on&mdash;tut,
tut! talk that gets nowhere. But he did say, quite
sincerely, I think, that my frankness called forth frankness
and avoided misunderstanding; for he has said that to
other people about me.</p>

<p>Such is the Prime Minister of Great Britain in this
supreme crisis in English history, a remarkable man, of an
abnormally quick mind, pretty nearly a great man, but
now a spent force, at once nimble and weary. History
may call him Great. If it do, he will owe this judgment
to the war, with the conduct of which his name will be
forever associated.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Page's homecoming was a tragedy. They
sailed from Liverpool on August 3rd, and reached New
York on the evening of August 11th. But sad news
awaited them upon the dock. About two months previously
their youngest son, Frank, had been married to
Miss Katherine Sefton, of Auburn, N.Y., and the young
couple had settled down in Garden City, Long Island.
That was the summer when the epidemic of infantile
paralysis swept over the larger part of the United States.
The young bride was stricken; the case was unusually
rapid and unusually severe; at the moment of the Pages'
arrival, they were informed that there was practically no
hope; and Mrs. Frank Page died at two o'clock on the
afternoon of the following day. The Pages had always
been a particularly united and happy family; this was the
first time that they had suffered from any domestic sorrow
of this kind, and the Ambassador was so affected that it
was with difficulty that he could summon himself for the
task that lay ahead.</p>

<p>In a few days, however, he left for Washington. He has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-171" id="page2-171"></a>[pg II-171]</span>
himself described his experience at the Capital in words
that must inevitably take their place in history. To appreciate
properly the picture which Page gives, it must be
remembered that the city and the officialdom which he
portrays are the same city and the same men who six
months afterward declared war on Germany. When
Page reached Washington, the Presidential campaign was
in full swing, with Mr. Wilson as the Democratic candidate
and Mr. Charles E. Hughes as the Republican. But
another crisis was absorbing the nation's attention: the
railway unions, comprising practically all the 2,000,000
railway employees in the United States, were threatening
to strike&mdash;ostensibly for an eight-hour day, in reality
for higher wages.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mr. Page's memorandum of his visit to Washington
in August, 1916</i></p></div>

<p>The President was very courteous to me, in his way.
He invited me to luncheon the day after I arrived. Present:
the President, Mrs. Wilson, Miss Bones, Tom Bolling,
his brother-in-law, and I. The conversation was
general and in the main jocular. Not a word about
England, not a word about a foreign policy or foreign
relations.</p>

<p>He explained that the threatened railway strike engaged
his whole mind. I asked to have a talk with him
when his mind should be free. Would I not go off and
rest and come back?&mdash;I preferred to do my minor errands
with the Department, but I should hold myself at his
convenience and at his command.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed. Another invitation to lunch.
Sharp, the Ambassador to France, had arrived. He, too,
was invited. Present: the President, Mrs. Wilson, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-172" id="page2-172"></a>[pg II-172]</span>
Wallace, the Misses Smith of New Orleans, Miss Bones,
Sharp, and I. Not one word about foreign affairs.</p>

<p>After luncheon, the whole party drove to the Capitol,
where the President addressed Congress on the strike,
proposing legislation to prevent it and to forestall similar
strikes. It is a simple ceremony and somewhat impressive.
The Senators occupy the front seats in the House,
the Speaker presides and the President of the Senate sits
on his right. An escorting committee is sent out to
bring the President in. He walks to the clerk's or reader's
desk below the presiding officer's, turns and shakes hands
with them both and then proceeds to read his speech, very
clearly and audibly. Some passages were applauded.
When he had done, he again shook hands with the presiding
officer and went out, preceded and followed by the
White House escort. I sat in the Presidential (or diplomatic?)
gallery with the White House party, higgledy-piggledy.</p>

<p>The speech ended, the President drove to the White
House with his escort in his car. The crowds in the corridors
and about the doors waited and crowded to see Mrs.
Wilson, quite respectful but without order or discipline.
We had to push our way through them. Now and then a
policeman at a distance would yell loudly, &quot;Make way
there!&quot;</p>

<p>When we reached the White House, I asked the doorman
if the President had arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does he expect me to go in and say good-bye?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he had no idea of talking with me now, if ever.
Not at lunch nor after did he suggest a conversation about
American-British affairs or say anything about my seeing
him again.</p>

<p>This threatened strike does hold his whole mind&mdash;bothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-173" id="page2-173"></a>[pg II-173]</span>
him greatly. It seems doubtful if he can avert a
general strike. The Republicans are trying &quot;to put him in
a political hole,&quot; and they say he, too, is playing politics.
Whoever be to blame for it, it is true that politics is in the
game. Nobody seems to foresee who will make capital
out of it. Surely I can't.</p>

<p>There's no social sense at the White House. The
President has at his table family connections only&mdash;and
they say few or no distinguished men and women are invited,
except the regular notables at the set dinners&mdash;the
diplomatic, the judiciary, and the like. His table is his
private family affair&mdash;nothing more. It is very hard to
understand why so intellectual a man doesn't have notable
men about him. It's the college professor's village habit,
I dare say. But it's a great misfortune. This is one way
in which Mr. Wilson shuts out the world and lives too
much alone, feeding only on knowledge and subjects that
he has already acquired and not getting new views or fresh
suggestions from men and women.</p>

<p>He sees almost nobody except members of Congress for
whom he sends for special conferences, and he usually sees
these in his office. The railroad presidents and men he
met in formal conference&mdash;no social touch.</p>

<p>A member of his Cabinet told me that Mr. Wilson had
shown confidence in him, given him a wide range of action
in his own Department and that he relies on his judgment.
This Cabinet member of course attends the
routine state dinners and receptions, as a matter of required
duty. But as for any social recognition of his
existence&mdash;he had never received a hint or nod. Nor
does any member of the Cabinet (except, no doubt, Mr.
McAdoo, his son-in-law). There is no social sense nor
reason in this. In fact, it works to a very decided disadvantage
to the President and to the Nation.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-174" id="page2-174"></a>[pg II-174]</span></div>
<p>By the way, that a notable man in our educational
life could form such a habit does not speak well for our
educational life.</p>

<p>What an unspeakably lamentable loss of opportunity!
This is the more remarkable and lamentable because the
President is a charming personality, an uncommonly
good talker, a man who could easily make personal friends
of all the world. He does his own thinking, untouched
by other men's ideas. He receives nothing from the outside.
His domestic life is spent with his own, nobody
else, except House occasionally. His contact with his
own Cabinet is a business man's contact with his business
associates and kind&mdash;at his office.</p>

<p>He declined to see Cameron Forbes<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41" /><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> on his return from
the Philippines.</p>

<p>The sadness of this mistake!</p>

<p>Another result is&mdash;the President doesn't hear the
frank truth about the men about him. He gives nobody
a chance to tell him. Hence he has several heavy encumbrances
in his official family.</p>

<p>The influence of this lone-hand way of playing the game
extends very far. The members of the Cabinet do not
seem to have the habit of frankness with one another.
Each lives and works in a water-tight compartment. I
sat at luncheon (at a hotel) with Lansing, Secretary of
State; Lane, Secretary of the Interior; Gregory, Attorney-General;
Baker, Secretary of War; Daniels, Secretary of
the Navy; and Sharp, Ambassador to France; and all the
talk was jocular or semi-jocular, and personal&mdash;mere
cheap chaff. Not a question was asked either of the Ambassador
to France or of the Ambassador to Great Britain
about the war or about our foreign relations. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-175" id="page2-175"></a>[pg II-175]</span>
war wasn't mentioned. Sharp and I might have come
from Bungtown and Jonesville and not from France and
England. We were not encouraged to talk&mdash;the local
personal joke held the time and conversation. This astounding
fact must be the result of this lone-hand, water-tight
compartment method and&mdash;of the neutrality suppression
of men. The Vice-President confessed to his
neighbour at a Gridiron dinner that he had read none of
the White Papers, or Orange Papers, etc., of the belligerent
governments&mdash;confessed this with pride&mdash;lest he should
form an opinion and cease to be neutral! Miss X, a
member of the President's household, said to Mrs. Y, the
day we lunched there, that she had made a remark privately
to Sharp showing her admiration of the French.</p>

<p>&quot;Was that a violation of neutrality?&quot; she asked in all
seriousness.</p>

<p>I can see it in no other way but this: the President suppressed
free thought and free speech when he insisted upon
personal neutrality. He held back the deliberate and
spontaneous thought and speech of the people except the
pro-Germans, who saw their chance and improved it!
The mass of the American people found themselves forbidden
to think or talk, and this forbidding had a sufficient
effect to make them take refuge in indifference. It's the
President's job. He's our leader. He'll attend to this
matter. We must not embarrass him. On this easy
cushion of non-responsibility the great masses fell back
at their intellectual and moral ease&mdash;softened, isolated,
lulled.</p>

<p>That wasn't leadership in a democracy. Right here is
the President's vast failure. From it there is now no escape
unless the Germans commit more submarine crimes.
They have kept the United States for their own exploiting
after the war. They have thus had a real triumph of us.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-176" id="page2-176"></a>[pg II-176]</span></div>
<p>I have talked in Washington with few men who showed
any clear conception of the difference between the Germans
and the British. To the minds of these people and
high Government officials, German and English are alike
foreign nations who are now foolishly engaged in war.
Two of the men who look upon the thing differently are
Houston<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42" /><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and Logan Waller Page<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43" /><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. In fact, there is no
realization of the war in Washington. Secretary Houston
has a proper perspective of the situation. He would have
done precisely what I recommended&mdash;paved the way for
claims and let the English take their course. &quot;International
law&quot; is no strict code and it's all shot to pieces
anyhow.</p>

<p>The Secretary [of State] betrayed not the slightest curiosity
about our relations with Great Britain. I saw
him several times&mdash;(1) in his office; (2) at his house;
(3) at the French Ambassador's; (4) at Wallace's; (5) at
his office; (6) at Crozier's<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44" /><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;this during my first stay in
Washington. The only remark he made was that I'd find
a different atmosphere in Washington from the atmosphere
in London. Truly. All the rest of his talk was about
&quot;cases.&quot; Would I see Senator Owen? Would I see Congressman
Sherley? Would I take up this &quot;case&quot; and
that? His mind ran on &quot;cases.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, at Y's, when I was almost in despair, I rammed
down him a sort of general statement of the situation as
I saw it; at least, I made a start. But soon he stopped
me and ran off at a tangent on some historical statement I
had made, showing that his mind was not at all on the real
subject, the large subject. When I returned to Washington,
and he had read my interviews with Grey, Asquith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-177" id="page2-177"></a>[pg II-177]</span>
and Bryce<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45" /><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, and my own statement, he still said nothing,
but he ceased to talk of &quot;cases.&quot; At my final interview
he said that he had had difficulty in preventing
Congress from making the retaliatory resolution mandatory.
He had tried to keep it back till the very end of
the session, etc.</p>

<p>This does not quite correspond with what the President
told me&mdash;that the State Department asked for this retaliatory
resolution.</p>

<p>I made specific suggestions in my statement to the
President and to Lansing. They have (yet) said nothing
about them. I fancy they will not. I have found nowhere
any policy&mdash;only &quot;cases.&quot;</p>

<p>I proposed to Baker and Daniels that they send a General
and an Admiral as attach&eacute;s to London. They both
agreed. Daniels later told me that Baker mentioned it
to the President and he &quot;stepped on the suggestion with
both feet.&quot; I did not bring it up. In the Franco-Prussian
War of 1870, both General McClellan (or Sheridan<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46" /><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>?)
and General Forsythe were sent to the German
Army. Our military ideas have shrunk since then!</p>

<p>I find at this date (a month before the Presidential
election), the greatest tangle and uncertainty of political
opinion that I have ever observed in our country. The
President, in spite of his unparalleled leadership and
authority in domestic policy, is by no means certain of
election. He has the open hostility of the Germans&mdash;all
very well, if he had got the fruits of a real hostility to
them; but they have, in many ways, directed his foreign
policy. He has lost the silent confidence of many men
upon whose conscience this great question weighs heavily.
If he be defeated he will owe his defeat to the loss of confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-178" id="page2-178"></a>[pg II-178]</span>
in his leadership on this great subject. His
opponent has put forth no clear-cut opinion. He plays a
silent game on the German &quot;issue.&quot; Yet he will command
the support of many patriotic men merely as a lack
of confidence in the President.</p>

<p>Nor do I see any end of the results of this fundamental
error. In the economic and political readjustment of the
world we shall be &quot;out of the game,&quot; in any event&mdash;unless
we are yet forced into the war by Hughes's election
or by the renewal of the indiscriminate use of submarines
by the Germans.</p>

<p>There is a great lesson in this lamentable failure of the
President really to lead the Nation. The United States
stands for democracy and free opinion as it stands for
nothing else and as no other nation stands for it. Now
when democracy and free opinion are at stake as they have
not before been, we take a &quot;neutral&quot; stand&mdash;we throw
away our very birthright. We may talk of &quot;humanity&quot;
all we like: we have missed the largest chance that ever
came to help the large cause that brought us into being as
a Nation....</p>

<p>And the people, sitting on the comfortable seats of
neutrality upon which the President has pushed them
back, are grateful for Peace, not having taken the trouble
to think out what Peace has cost us and cost the world&mdash;except
so many as have felt the uncomfortable stirrings
of the national conscience.</p>

<p>There is not a man in our State Department or in our
Government who has ever met any prominent statesmen
in any European Government&mdash;except the third Assistant
Secretary of State, who has no authority in forming policies;
there is not a man who knows the atmosphere of Europe.
Yet when I proposed that one of the under Secretaries
should go to England on a visit of a few weeks for observation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-179" id="page2-179"></a>[pg II-179]</span>
the objection arose that such a visit would not be
&quot;neutral.&quot;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The extraordinary feature of this experience was that
Page had been officially summoned home, presumably to
discuss the European situation, and that neither the President
nor the State Department apparently had the slightest
interest in his visit.</p>

<p>&quot;The President,&quot; Page wrote to Mr. Laughlin, &quot;dominates
the whole show in a most extraordinary way. The
men about him (and he sees them only on 'business') are
very nearly all very, very small fry, or worse&mdash;the narrowest
twopenny lot I've ever come across. He has
no real companions. Nobody talks to him freely and
frankly. I've never known quite such a condition in
American life.&quot; Perhaps the President had no desire to
discuss inconvenient matters with his Ambassador to Great
Britain, but Page was certainly determined to have an
interview with the President. &quot;I'm not going back to
London,&quot; he wrote Mr. Laughlin, &quot;till the President has
said something to me or at least till I have said something
to him. I am now going down to Garden City and New
York till the President send for me; or, if he do not send
for me, I'm going to his house and sit on his front steps till
he come out!&quot; Page had brought from England one of
the medals which the Germans had struck in honour of the
<i>Lusitania</i> sinking, and one reason why he particularly
wished to see the President alone was to show him this
memento.</p>

<p>Another reason was that in early September Page had received
important news from London concerning the move
which Germany was making for peace and the attitude
of Great Britain in this matter. The several plans which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-180" id="page2-180"></a>[pg II-180]</span>
Germany had had under consideration had now taken the
form of a definite determination to ask for an armistice
before winter set in. A letter from Mr. Laughlin, Charg&eacute;
d'affaires in Page's absence, tells the story.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>From Irwin Laughlin</i><br />
<br />
Embassy of the United States of America.<br />
London, August 30, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PAGE:</p>

<p>For some little time past I have heard persistent rumours,
which indeed are more than rumours, since they
have come from important sources, of an approaching
movement by Germany toward an early armistice. They
have been so circumstantial and so closely connected&mdash;in
prospect&mdash;with the President, that I have examined them
with particular attention and I shall try to give you the
results, and my conclusions, with the recommendation
that you take the matter up directly with the President
and the Secretary of State. I have been a little at a loss
to decide how to communicate what I have learned to the
Government in Washington, for the present conditions
make it impossible to set down what I want to say in an
official despatch, but the fortunate accident of your being
in the United States gives me the safe opportunity I want,
and so I send my information to you, and by the pouch,
as time is of less importance than secrecy.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that Germany is casting
about for an opportunity to effect an armistice, if possible
before the winter closes in. She hopes it may result in
peace&mdash;a peace more or less favourable to her, of course&mdash;but
even if such a result should fail of accomplishment she
would have gained a breathing space; have secured an opportunity
to improve her strategic position in a military
sense, perhaps by shortening her line in Flanders: have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-181" id="page2-181"></a>[pg II-181]</span>
stiffened the resistance of her people; and probably have
influenced a certain body of neutral opinion not only in
her favour but against her antagonists.</p>

<p>I shall not try to mention the various sources from
which the threads that compose this fabric have been
drawn, but I finally fastened on X of the Admiralty as a
man with whom I could talk profitably and confidentially,
and he told me positively that his information showed
that Germany was looking in the direction I have indicated,
and that she would soon approach the President on
the subject&mdash;even if she had not already taken the first
steps toward preparing her advance to him.</p>

<p>I asked X if he thought it well for me to broach the
subject to Lord Grey and he suggested that I first consult
Y, which I did. The latter seemed very wary at the outset,
but he warmed up at last and in the course of the conversation
told me he had reliable information that when
Bethmann-Hollweg went to Munich just before the beginning
of the allied offensive in the west in June he told
the King of Bavaria that he was confident the Allies would
be obliged to begin overtures for peace next October; adding
that if they didn't Germany would have to do so.
The King, it appears, asked him how Germany could
approach the Allies if it proved to be advisable and he replied:
&quot;Through our good friend Wilson.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked Y if the King of Spain's good offices would not
be enlisted jointly with those of the President in attempting
to arrange an armistice, but he thought not, and said
that the King of Spain was very well aware that the Allies
would not consider anything short of definite peace proposals
from Germany and that His Majesty knew the
moment for them had not arrived. I then finally asked
him point blank if he thought the Germans would approach
the President for an armistice, and, if so, when.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-182" id="page2-182"></a>[pg II-182]</span>
He said he was inclined to think they might do so perhaps
about October. On my asking him if he was disposed to
let me communicate his opinion privately to the Government
in Washington he replied after some hesitation that
he had no objection, but he quickly added that I must
make it clear at the same time that the British Government
would not listen to any such proposals.</p>

<p>These conversations took place during the course of
last week, and on Sunday&mdash;the 27th&mdash;I invited the Spanish
Ambassador to luncheon at Tangley when I was able
to get him to confirm what Y had said of his Sovereign's
attitude and opinions.</p>

<p>I may mention for what it is worth that on Hoover's
last trip to Germany he was told by Bullock, of the Philadelphia
<i>Ledger</i>, that Zimmermann of the Berlin Foreign
Office had told him that the Germans had intended in
June to take steps for an armistice which were prevented
by the preparations for the allied offensive in the west.</p>

<p>Y was very emphatic in what he said of the attitude of
his government and the British people toward continuing
the war to an absolutely conclusive end, and I was much
impressed. He said among other things that the execution
of Captain Fryatt had had a markedly perceptible
effect in hardening British public opinion against Germany
and fixing the determination to fight to a relentless finish.
This corresponds exactly with my own observations.</p>

<p>I leave this letter entirely in your hands. You will
know what use to make of it. It is meant as an official
communication in everything but the usual form from
which I have departed for reasons I need not explain
further.</p>

<p>I look forward eagerly to your return,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>While I am waiting for a convenient time to come
when you will see me for a conference and report, I send
you notes on conversations with Lord Grey and Lord
Bryce<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47" /><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. They are, in effect, though of course not in form,
messages to you.</p>

<p>The situation between our government and Great
Britain seems to me most alarming; and (let me add)
easily removable, if I can get the ear of anybody in authority.
But I find here only an atmosphere of suspicion&mdash;unwarranted
by facts and easily dissipated by straight and
simple friendly methods. I am sure of this.</p>

<p>I have, besides, a most important and confidential
message for you from the British Government which
they prefer should be orally delivered.</p>

<p>And I have written out a statement of my own study of
the situation and of certain proposals which, I think, if
they commend themselves to you, will go far to remove
this dangerous tension. I hope to go over them with you
at your convenience.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours faithfully,<br />
<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>The situation was alarming for more reasons than the
determination of Germany to force the peace issue. The
State Department was especially irritated at this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-184" id="page2-184"></a>[pg II-184]</span>
over the blockade. Among the &quot;trade advisers&quot; there
was a conviction, which all Page's explanations had not
destroyed, that Great Britain was using the blockade as
a means of destroying American commerce and securing
America's customers for herself. Great Britain's regulations
on the blacklist and &quot;bunker coal&quot; had intensified
this feeling. In both these latter questions Page regarded
the British actions as tactless and unjust; he had had many
sharp discussions at the Foreign Office concerning them,
but had not made much headway in his efforts to obtain
their abandonment. The purpose of the &quot;blacklist&quot;
was to strike at neutral firms with German affiliations
which were trading with Germany. The Trading with the
Enemy Act provided that such firms could not trade with
Great Britain; that British vessels must refuse to accept
their cargoes, and that any neutral ship which accepted
such cargoes would be denied bunker coal at British ports.
Under this law the Ministry of Blockade issued a &quot;blacklist&quot;
of more than 1,000 proscribed exporting houses in
the United States. So great was the indignation against
this boycott in the United States that Congress, in early
September, had passed a retaliatory act; this gave the
President the authority at any time to place an embargo
upon the exports to the United States of countries which
discriminated against American firms and also to deny
clearance to ships which refused to accept American cargoes.
The two countries indeed seemed to be hastening
toward a crisis.</p>

<p>Page's urgent letter to Mr. Wilson brought a telegram
from Mr. Tumulty inviting the Ambassador to spend the
next evening and night with the President at Shadow
Lawn, the seaside house on the New Jersey coast in which
Mr. Wilson was spending the summer. Mr. Wilson received
his old friend with great courtesy and listened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-185" id="page2-185"></a>[pg II-185]</span>
quietly and with apparent interest to all that he had to say.
The written statement to which Page refers in his letter
told the story of Anglo-American relations from the time
of the Panama tolls repeal up to the time of Page's visit
to Shadow Lawn. Quotations have already been made
from it in preceding chapters, and the ideas which it
contains have abundantly appeared in letters already
printed. The document was an eloquent plea for American
co&ouml;peration with the Allies&mdash;for the dismissal of
Bernstorff, for the adoption of a manly attitude toward
Germany, and for the vindication of a high type of Americanism.</p>

<p>Page showed the President the <i>Lusitania</i> medal, but
that did not especially impress him. &quot;The President
said to me,&quot; wrote Page in reference to this visit,
&quot;that when the war began he and all the men he met
were in hearty sympathy with the Allies; but that now
the sentiment toward England had greatly changed.
He saw no one who was not vexed and irritated by the
arbitrary English course. That is, I fear, true&mdash;that
he sees no one but has a complaint. So does the Secretary
of State, and the Trade Bureau and all the rest
in Washington. But in Boston, in New York, and in
the South and in Auburn, N.Y., I saw no one whose
sympathy with the Allies had undergone any fundamental
change. I saw men who felt vexed at such an
act as the blacklist, but that was merely vexation, not
a fundamental change of feeling. Of course, there
came to see me men who had 'cases.' Now these are
the only kind of men, I fear, whom the Government at
Washington sees&mdash;these and the members of Congress
whom the Germans have scared or have 'put up' to
scare the Government&mdash;who are 'twisting the lion's tail,'
in a word.&quot;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-186" id="page2-186"></a>[pg II-186]</span></div>
<p>&quot;The President said,&quot; wrote Page immediately after
coming from Shadow Lawn, &quot;Tell those gentlemen for
me'&mdash;and then followed a homily to the effect that a damage
done to any American citizen is a damage to him, etc.
He described the war as a result of many causes, some
of long origin. He spoke of England's having the earth
and of Germany wanting it. Of course, he said, the
German system is directly opposed to everything American.
But I do not gather that he thought that this
carried any very great moral reprehensibility.</p>

<p>&quot;He said that he wouldn't do anything with the retaliatory
act till after election lest it might seem that
he was playing politics. But he hinted that if there were
continued provocation afterward (in case he were elected)
he would. He added that one of the worst provocations
was the long English delay in answering our Notes.
Was this delay due to fear or shame? He evidently
felt that such a delay showed contempt. He spoke of
the Bryan treaty<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48" /><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. But on no question had the British
'locked horns' with us&mdash;on no question had they come
to a clear issue so that the matter might be referred to
the Commission.&quot;</p>

<p>Page delivered his oral message about the German
determination to obtain an armistice. This was to the
effect that Great Britain would not grant it. Page intimated
that Britain would be offended if the President
proposed it.</p>

<p>&quot;If an armistice, no,&quot; answered Mr. Wilson. &quot;That's
a military matter and is none of my business. But if
they propose an armistice looking toward peace&mdash;yes,
I shall be glad.&quot;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-187" id="page2-187"></a>[pg II-187]</span></div>
<p>The experience was an exceedingly trying one for both
men. The discussion showed how far apart were the
President and his Ambassador on practically every issue
connected with the crisis. Naturally the President's
reference to the causes of the war&mdash;that there were many
causes, some of them of long persistence, and that Great
Britain's domination of the &quot;earth&quot; was one of them&mdash;conflicted
with the judgment of a man who attributed
the origin of the struggle to German aggression. The
President's statement that American sympathy for
the Allies had now changed to irritation, and the tolerant
attitude toward Germany which Mr. Wilson displayed,
affected Page with the profoundest discouragement.
The President's intimation that he would advance Germany's
request for an armistice, if it looked toward
peace&mdash;this in reply to Page's message that Great Britain
would not receive such a proposal in a kindly spirit&mdash;seemed
to lay the basis of further misunderstandings.
The interview was a disheartening one for Page. Many
people whom the Ambassador met in the course of this
visit still retain memories of his fervour in what had now
become with him a sacred cause. With many friends and
officials he discussed the European situation almost like a
man inspired. The present writer recalls two long conversations
with Page at this time: the recollection of his brilliant
verbal portraiture, his description of the determination
of Englishmen, his admiration for the heroic sacrifice
of Englishwomen, remain as about the most vivid memories
of a life-time. And now the Ambassador had brought
this same eloquence to the President's ear at Shadow
Lawn. It was in this interview that Page had hoped to
show Mr. Wilson the real merits of the situation, and persuade
him to adopt the course to which the national honour
and safety pointed; he talked long and eloquently, painting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-188" id="page2-188"></a>[pg II-188]</span>
the whole European tragedy with that intensity and
readiness of utterance and that moral conviction which
had so moved all others with whom he had come into contact
during this memorable visit to the United States; but
Mr. Wilson was utterly cold, utterly unresponsive, interested
only in ending the war. The talk lasted for a whole
morning; its nature may be assumed from the many letters
already printed; but Page's voice, when it attempted to fire
the conscience of the President, proved as ineffective as
his pen. However, there was nothing rasping or contentious
about the interview. The two men discussed everything
with the utmost calmness and without the slightest
indications of ill-nature. Both men had in mind
their long association, both inevitably recalled the hopes
with which they had begun their official relationship
three years before, at that time neither having the
faintest intimation of the tremendous problems that were
to draw them asunder. Mr. Wilson at this meeting
did not impress his Ambassador as a perverse character,
but as an extremely pathetic one. Page came away
with no vexation or anger, but with a real feeling for a
much suffering and a much perplexed statesman. The
fact that the President's life was so solitary, and that
he seemed to be so completely out of touch with men and
with the living thoughts of the world, appealed strongly
to Page's sympathies. &quot;I think he is the loneliest man
I have ever known,&quot; Page remarked to his son Frank
after coming away from this visit.</p>

<p>Page felt this at the time, for, as he rose to say good-bye
to the President, he put his hand upon his shoulder.
At this Mr. Wilson's eyes filled with tears and he gave
Page an affectionate good-bye. The two men never met
again.</p>

<h3>&quot;PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY&quot;</h3>


<p>&quot;Of one thing I am sure,&quot; Page wrote to his wife
from Washington, while waiting to see President
Wilson. &quot;We wish to come home March 4th at midnight
and to go about our proper business. There's nothing
here that I would for the world be mixed up with. As
soon as I can escape with dignity I shall make my bow and
exit.... But I am not unhappy or hopeless for the
long run. They'll find out the truth some day, paying, I
fear, a heavy penalty for delay. But the visit here has confirmed
me in our previous conclusions&mdash;that if we can carry
the load until March 4th, midnight, we shall be grateful
that we have pulled through.&quot;</p>

<p>Soon after President Wilson's re&euml;lection, therefore,
Page sent his resignation to Washington. The above
quotation shows that he intended this to be more than a
&quot;courtesy resignation,&quot; a term traditionally applied to the
kind of leave-takings which Ambassadors usually send
on the formation of a new administration, or at the beginning
of a new Presidential term, for the purpose of giving
the President the opportunity of reorganizing his official
family. Page believed that his work in London had
been finished, that he had done everything in his power
to make Mr. Wilson see the situation in its true light and
that he had not succeeded. He therefore wished to give
up his post and come home. This explains the fact that
his resignation did not consist of the half dozen perfunctory
lines which most diplomatic officers find sufficient on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-190" id="page2-190"></a>[pg II-190]</span>
such an occasion, but took the form of a review of the
reasons why the United States should align itself on the
side of the Allies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
London, November 24, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>We have all known for many years that the rich and
populous and organized states in which the big cities are
do not constitute the political United States. But, I
confess, I hardly expected so soon to see this fact proclaimed
at the ballot-box. To me that's the surprise of
the election. And your popular majority as well as your
clear majority in the Electoral College is a great personal
triumph for you. And you have remade the ancient and
demoralized Democratic party. Four years ago it consisted
of a protest and of the wreck wrought by Mr.
Bryan's long captaincy. This rebirth, with a popular
majority, is an historical achievement&mdash;of your own.</p>

<p>You have relaid the foundation and reset the pillars of
a party that may enjoy a long supremacy for domestic
reasons. Now, if you will permit me to say so, from my
somewhat distant view (four years make a long period of
absence) the big party task is to build up a clearer and
more positive foreign policy. We are in the world and
we've got to choose what active part we shall play in it&mdash;I
fear rather quickly. I have the conviction, as you know,
that this whole round globe now hangs as a ripe apple for
our plucking, if we use the right ladder while the chance
lasts. I do not mean that we want or could get the apple
for ourselves, but that we can see to it that it is put to
proper uses. What we have to do, in my judgment, is to
go back to our political fathers for our clue. If my longtime
memory be good, they were sure that their establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-191" id="page2-191"></a>[pg II-191]</span>
of a great free Republic would soon be imitated by
European peoples&mdash;that democracies would take the place
of autocracies in all so-called civilized countries; for that
was the form that the fight took in their day against
organized Privilege. But for one reason or another&mdash;in
our life-time partly because we chose so completely to isolate
ourselves&mdash;the democratic idea took root in Europe
with disappointing slowness. It is, for instance, now
perhaps for the first time, in a thoroughgoing way, within
sight in this Kingdom. The dream of the American
Fathers, therefore, is not yet come true. They fought
against organized Privilege exerted from over the sea. In
principle it is the same fight that we have made, in our
domestic field, during recent decades. Now the same
fight has come on a far larger scale than men ever dreamed
of before.</p>

<p>It isn't, therefore, for merely doctrinal reasons that we
are concerned for the spread of democracy nor merely
because a democracy is the only scheme of organization yet
wrought out that keeps the door of opportunity open and
invites all men to their fullest development. But we are
interested in it because under no other system can the
world be made an even reasonably safe place to live in.
For only autocracies wage aggressive wars. Aggressive
autocracies, especially military autocracies, must be
softened down by peace (and they have never been so
softened) or destroyed by war. The All-Highest doctrine
of Germany to-day is the same as the Taxation-without-Representation
of George III&mdash;only more virulent,
stronger, and farther-reaching. Only by its end can the
German people recover and build up their character and
take the permanent place in the world that they&mdash;thus
changed&mdash;will be entitled to. They will either reduce
Europe to the vassalage of a military autocracy, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-192" id="page2-192"></a>[pg II-192]</span>
may then overrun the whole world or drench it in blood,
or they must through stages of Liberalism work their way
toward some approach to a democracy; and there is no
doubt which event is impending. The Liberal idea will
win this struggle, and Europe will be out of danger of
a general assault on free institutions till some other autocracy
which has a military caste try the same Napoleonic
game. The defeat of Germany, therefore, will make for the
spread of the doctrine of our Fathers and our doctrine yet.</p>

<p>An interesting book might be made of concrete evidences
of the natural antipathy that the present German
autocracy has for successful democracy and hence for us.
A new instance has just come to me. My son, Arthur,
who succeeded to most of my activities at home, has been
over here for a month and he has just come from a visit to
France. In Paris he had a long conversation with Delcass&eacute;,
who told him that the Kaiser himself once made a
proposal to him to join in producing &quot;the complete isolation&quot;
of the United States. What the Kaiser meant was
that if the great Powers of Europe would hold off, he
would put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and smash it.</p>

<p>The great tide of the world will, by reason of the war,
now flow toward democracy&mdash;at present, alas! a tide of
blood. For a century democracies and Liberal governments
have kept themselves too much isolated, trusting
prematurely and too simply to international law and
treaties and Hague conventions. These things have
never been respected, except as springs to catch woodcock,
where the Divine Right held sway. The outgrowing
or the overthrow of the Divine Right is a condition
precedent to the effectiveness of international law and
treaties.</p>

<p>It has seemed to me, looking at the subject only with
reference to our country's duty and safety, that somehow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-193" id="page2-193"></a>[pg II-193]</span>
and at some early time our championship of democracy
must lead us to redeclare our faith and to show that we
believe in our historic creed. Then we may escape falling
away from the Liberal forces of the Old World and escape
the suspicion of indifference to the great scheme of government
which was set up by our fathers' giving their
blood for it. I see no other way for us to take the best
and biggest opportunity that has ever come to prove true
to our faith as well as to secure our own safety and the
safety of the world. Only some sort of active and open
identification with the Allies can put us in effective protest
against the assassins of the Armenians and the assassins
of Belgium, Poland, and Serbia, and in a friendly attitude
to the German people themselves, as distinguished from
their military rulers. This is the attitude surely that our
fathers would have wished us to take&mdash;and would have
expected us to take&mdash;and that our children will be proud
of us for taking; for it is our proper historic attitude,
whether looked at from the past or looked back at from the
future. There can be no historic approval of neutrality
for years, while the world is bleeding to death.</p>

<p>The complete severance of relations, diplomatic at first
and later possibly economic as well, with the Turks and
the Germans, would probably not cost us a man in battle
nor any considerable treasure; for the moral effect of
withdrawing even our formal approval of their conduct&mdash;at
least our passive acquiescence&mdash;would be&mdash;that the Germans
would see that practically all the Liberal world
stands against their system, and the war would end before
we should need to or could put an army in the field.
The Liberal Germans are themselves beginning to see
that it is not they, but the German system, that is the
object of attack because it is <i>the</i> dangerous thing in the
world. Maximilian Harden presents this view in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-194" id="page2-194"></a>[pg II-194]</span>
Berlin paper. He says in effect that Germany must get
rid of its predatory feudalism. That was all that was
the matter with George III.</p>

<p>Among the practical results of such action by us would,
I believe, be the following:</p>

<p>1. The early ending of the war and the saving of, perhaps,
millions of lives and of incalculable treasure;</p>

<p>2. The establishment in Germany of some form of
more liberal government;</p>

<p>3. A league to enforce peace, ready-made, under our
guidance&mdash;i.e., the Allies and ourselves;</p>

<p>4. The sympathetic co&ouml;peration and the moral force of
every Allied Government in dealing with Mexico:</p>

<p>5. The acceptance&mdash;and even documentary approval&mdash;of
every Allied Government of the Monroe Doctrine;</p>

<p>6. The warding off and no doubt the final prevention
of danger from Japan, and, most of all, the impressive
and memorable spectacle of our Great Democracy thus
putting an end to this colossal crime, merely from the
impulse and necessity to keep our own ideals and to lead
the world right on. We should do for Europe on a large
scale essentially what we did for Cuba on a small scale and
thereby usher in a new era in human history.</p>

<p>I write thus freely, Mr. President, because at no time
can I write in any other way and because I am sure that all
these things can quickly be brought to pass under your
strong leadership. The United States would stand, as
no other nation has ever stood in the world&mdash;predominant
and unselfish&mdash;on the highest ideals ever reached in
human government. It is a vision as splendid as the
Holy Grael. Nor have I a shadow of doubt of the eager
and faithful following of our people, who would thereby
re&euml;stablish once for all our weakened nationality. We
are made of the stuff that our Fathers were made of.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-195" id="page2-195"></a>[pg II-195]</span>
<p>And I write this now for the additional reason that I
am within sight of the early end of my service here. When
you called me I answered, not only because you did me
great honour and laid a definite patriotic duty on me, but
because also of my personal loyalty to you and my pride
in helping forward the great principles in which we both
believe. But I understood then (and I am sure the subject
lay in your mind in the same way) that my service
would be for four years at the most. I made all my arrangements,
professional and domestic, on this supposition.
I shall, therefore, be ready to lay down my work
here on March 4th or as soon thereafter as meets your
pleasure.</p>

<p>I am more than proud of the confidence that you have
shown in me. To it I am indebted for the opportunity
I have had to give such public service to my country as
I could, as well as for the most profitable experience of
my life. A proper and sympathetic understanding between
the two English-speaking worlds seems to me the
most important duty of far-seeing men in either country.
It has taken such a profound hold on me that I shall, in
whatever way I can, work for its complete realization as
long as I can work for anything.</p>

<p>I am, Mr. President, most faithfully and gratefully
yours,</p>

<p>WALTER H. PAGE.</p></div>

<p>This letter was written at a time when President Wilson
was exerting his best energies to bring about peace. The
Presidential campaign had caused him to postpone these
efforts, for he believed that neither Germany nor Great
Britain could take seriously the activities of a President
whose own political position was insecure. At the time
Page's letter was received, the President was thinking only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-196" id="page2-196"></a>[pg II-196]</span>
of a peace based upon a stalemate; it was then his apparent
conviction that both sides to the struggle were about
equally in the wrong and that a decisive victory of either
would not be a good thing for the world. Yet it is interesting
to compare this letter with the famous speech
which the President made six months afterward when
he asked Congress to declare the existence of a state of
war with Germany. Practically all the important reasons
which Mr. Wilson then advanced for this declaration are
found in Page's letter of the preceding November. That
autocracies are a constant menace to world peace, that
the United States owes it to its democratic tradition to
take up arms against the enemy of free government, that
in doing this, it was not making war upon the German
people, but upon its imperialistic masters&mdash;these were the
arguments which Page laid before the President in his letter
of resignation, and these were the leading ideas in Mr.
Wilson's address of April 2nd. There are even sentences
in Page's communication which seem to foreshadow Mr.
Wilson's assertion that &quot;The world must be made safe
for democracy.&quot; This letter in itself sufficiently makes it
clear that Page's correspondence, irritating in its later
phases as it may have been, strongly influenced Mr. Wilson
in his final determination on war.</p>

<p>On one point, indeed, Colonel House afterward called
the Ambassador to account. When America was preparing
to raise armies by the millions and to spend its
treasure by the billions, he reminded Page of his statement
that the severance of diplomatic relations &quot;would probably
not cost us a man in battle nor any considerable
treasure.&quot; Page's statement in this November letter
merely reiterated a conviction which for more than a year
he had been forcing upon the President and Colonel
House&mdash;that the dismissal of Bernstorff would not necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-197" id="page2-197"></a>[pg II-197]</span>
imply war with Germany, but that it would in itself
be enough to bring the war to an end. On this point Page
never changed his mind, as is evident from the letter which
he wrote to Colonel House when this matter was called to
his attention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Edward M. House</i><br />
<br />
London, June 29, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>I never put any particular value on my own prophecies
nor on anybody else's. I have therefore no pride as a
prophet. Yet I do think that I hit it off accurately a
year or a year and a half ago when I said that we could
then have ended the war without any appreciable cost.
And these are my reasons:</p>

<p>If we had then come in and absolutely prevented supplies
from reaching Germany, as we are now about to do,
the war would then have been much sooner ended than it
can now be ended:</p>

<p>(1) Our supplies enabled her to go on.</p>

<p>(2) She got time in this way to build her great submarine
fleet. She went at it the day she promised the
President to reform.</p>

<p>(3) She got time and strength to overrun Rumania
whence she got food and oil; and continues to get it.</p>

<p>(4) During this time Russia fell down as a military
force and gave her more time, more armies for France
and more supplies. Russian guns have been sold to the
Germans.</p>

<p>If a year and a half ago we had starved her out, it
would have been over before any of these things happened.
This delay is what will cost us billions and
billions and men and men.</p>

<p>And it cost us one thing more. During the neutrality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-198" id="page2-198"></a>[pg II-198]</span>
period we were as eager to get goods to the little neutral
states which were in large measure undoubtedly bound to
Germany as we are now eager to keep them out. Grey,
who was and is our best friend, and who was unwilling
to quarrel with us more than he was obliged to, was thrown
out of office and his career ended because the blockade,
owing to his consideration for us, was not tight enough.
Our delay caused his fall.</p>

<p>But most of all, it gave the Germans time (and to some
extent material) to build their present fleet of submarines.
They were at work on them all the while and according to
the best opinion here they continue to build them faster
than the British destroy them; and the submarines are
destroying more merchant ships than all the shipbuilding
docks of all the world are now turning out. This is
the most serious aspect of the war&mdash;by far the most
serious. I am trying to get our Government to send
over hundreds of improvised destroyers&mdash;armed tugs,
yachts, etc., etc. Admiral Sims and the British Admiralty
have fears that unless such help come the full fruits of the
war may never be gathered by the Allies&mdash;that some sort
of a compromise peace may have to be made.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, true that the year and a half we waited
after the <i>Lusitania</i> will prove to be the most costly year
and a half in our history; and for once at least my old
prophecy was quite a good guess. But that water has
flowed over the dam and it is worth mentioning now only
because you challenged me....</p></div>

<p>That part of Page's letter which refers to his retirement
had a curious history. It was practically a resignation
and therefore called for an immediate reply, but Mr.
Wilson did not even acknowledge its receipt. For two
months the Ambassador was left in the dark as to the attitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-199" id="page2-199"></a>[pg II-199]</span>
of Washington. Finally, in the latter part of January,
1917, Page wrote urgently to Mr. Lansing, asking
him to bring the matter to the President's attention. On
February 5, 1917, Mr. Lansing's reply was received.
&quot;The President,&quot; he said, &quot;under extreme pressure of the
present situation, has been unable to consider your communication
in regard to your resignation. He desires me
to inform you that he hopes that, at the present time, you
will not press to be relieved from service; that he realizes
that he is asking you to make a personal sacrifice, but he
believes that you will appreciate the importance, in the
crisis which has developed, that no change should be made.
I hardly need to add my personal hope that you will put
aside any thought of resigning your post for the present.&quot;</p>

<p>At this time, of course, any idea of retiring was out of
the question. The President had dismissed Bernstorff
and there was every likelihood that the country would
soon be at war. Page would have regarded his retirement
at this crisis as little less than the desertion of his
post. Moreover, since Mr. Wilson had adopted the policy
which the Ambassador had been urging for nearly two
years, and had sent Bernstorff home, any logical excuse
that may have existed for his resignation existed no longer.
Mr. Wilson had now adopted a course which Page could
enthusiastically support.</p>

<p>&quot;I am happy to serve here at any sacrifice&quot;&mdash;such was
his reply to Mr. Lansing&mdash;&quot;until after the end of the war,
and I am making my arrangements to stay for this
period.&quot;</p>

<p>The months that intervened between the Presidential
election and the declaration of war were especially difficult
for the American Embassy in London. Page had informed
the President, in the course of his interview of
September 22nd, how unfavourably Great Britain regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-200" id="page2-200"></a>[pg II-200]</span>
his efforts in the direction of peace; he had in
fact delivered a message from the Foreign Office that
any Presidential attempt to &quot;mediate&quot; would be rejected
by the Allies. Yet his earnest representation on this
point had produced no effect upon Mr. Wilson. The
pressure which Germany was bringing to bear upon Washington
was apparently irresistible. Count Bernstorff's
memoirs, with their accompanying documents, have revealed
the intensity of the German efforts during this
period; the most startling fact revealed by the German
Ambassador is that the Kaiser, on October 9th, notified
the President, almost in so many words, that, unless he
promptly moved in the direction of peace, the German
Government &quot;would be forced to regain the freedom of
action which it has reserved to itself in the note of May
4th last<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49" /><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.&quot; It is unlikely that the annals of diplomacy
contain many documents so cool and insolent as this one.
It was a notification from the Kaiser to the President that
the so-called &quot;Sussex pledge&quot; was not regarded as an
unconditional one by the Imperial Government; that it
was given merely to furnish Mr. Wilson an opportunity to
bring the war to an end; and that unless the Presidential
attempt to accomplish this were successful, there would be
a resumption of the indiscriminate submarine campaign.
The curious developments of the next two months are
now a familiar story. Possibly because the British Government
had notified him, through Page, that his proffer of
mediation would be unacceptable, Mr. Wilson moved
cautiously and slowly, and Germany became impatient.
The successful campaign against Rumania, resulting in the
capture of Bucharest on December 6th, and the new vista
which it opened to Germany of large food supplies,
strengthened the Teutonic purpose. Perhaps Germany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-201" id="page2-201"></a>[pg II-201]</span>
with her characteristic lack of finesse, imagined that her
own open efforts would lend emphasis to Mr. Wilson's
pacific exertions. At any rate, on December 12th, just as
Mr. Wilson was preparing to launch his own campaign for
mediation, Germany herself approached her enemies with a
proposal for a peace conference. A few days afterward
Page, as the representative of Germany, called at the Foreign
Office to deliver the large white envelope which contained
the Kaiser's &quot;peace proposal.&quot; In delivering this to
Lord Robert Cecil, who was acting as Foreign Secretary
in the temporary absence of Mr. Balfour, Page emphasized
the fact that the American Government entirely disassociated
itself from its contents and that he was acting
merely in his capacity of &quot;German Ambassador.&quot; Two
communications from Lord Robert to Sir Cecil Spring
Rice, British Ambassador at Washington, tell the story
and also reveal that it was almost impossible for Page,
even when engaged in an official proceeding, to conceal
his contempt for the whole enterprise:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>Lord R. Cecil to Sir C. Spring Rice</i><br />
<br />
Foreign Office,<br />
<br />
December 18, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>SIR:</p>

<p>The American Ambassador came to see me this morning
and presented to me the German note containing what is
called in it the &quot;offer of peace.&quot; He explained that he
did so on instructions of his Government as representing
the German Government, and not in any way as representing
their own opinions. He also explained that the
note must be regarded as coming from the four Central
Powers, and as being addressed to all the Entente Powers
who were represented by the United States.</p>

<p>He then read to me a telegram from his Government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-202" id="page2-202"></a>[pg II-202]</span>
but declined to leave me a copy of it. The first part of
the telegram explained that the Government of the United
States would deeply appreciate a confidential intimation
of the response to be made to the German note and that
they would themselves have certain representations to
make to the Entente Powers, to which they urgently
begged the closest consideration. The telegram went on
to explain that the Government of the United States had
had it in mind for some time past to make such representations
on behalf of neutral nations and humanity, and
that it must not be thought that they were prompted by
the Governments of the Central Powers. They wished
us to understand that the note of the Central Powers
created a good opportunity for making the American
representations, but was not the cause of such representations
being made.</p>

<p>I replied that I could of course say nothing to him on
such an important matter without consulting my colleagues.</p></div>

19 December, 1916.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>SIR:</p>

<p>The American Ambassador came to see me this afternoon.</p>

<p>I asked him whether he could tell me why his government
were anxious to have confidential information as to
the nature of our response to the German peace note.
He replied that he did not know, but he imagined it
was to enable them to frame the representations of which
he had spoken to me.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-203" id="page2-203"></a>[pg II-203]</span>
<p>I then told him that we had asked the French to draft
a reply, and that it would then be considered by the Allies,
and in all probability an identic note would be presented
in answer to the German note. I thought it probable that
we should express our view that it was impossible to deal
with the German offer, since it contained no specific proposals.</p>

<p>He said that he quite understood this, and that we
should in fact reply that it was an offer &quot;to buy a pig in a
poke&quot; which we were not prepared to accept. He added
that he thought his Government would fully anticipate a
reply in this sense, and he himself obviously approved it.</p>

<p>Then, speaking quite seriously, he said that he had
heard people in London treating the German offer with
derision, but that no doubt the belligerent governments
would treat it seriously.</p>

<p>I said that it was certainly a serious thing, and no doubt
would be treated seriously.</p>

<p>I asked him if he knew what would be contained in the
proposed representations from his government.</p>

<p>He said that he did not; but as he understood that they
were to be made to all the belligerents, he did not think
that they could be much more than a pious aspiration for
peace; since that was the only thing that was equally
applicable to the Germans and to us.</p>

<p>As he was leaving he suggested that the German note
might be published in our press.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
I am, etc.,<br />
<br />
ROBERT CECIL.<br />
</div>

<p>This so-called German &quot;peace proposal&quot; began with
the statement that the war &quot;had been forced&quot; upon Germany,
contained the usual reference to the military might
of the Central Powers, and declared that the Fatherland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-204" id="page2-204"></a>[pg II-204]</span>
was fighting for &quot;the honour and liberty of national
evolution.&quot; It is therefore not surprising that Lord
Robert received it somewhat sardonically, especially as the
communication contained no specific proposals, but
merely a vague suggestion of &quot;negotiations.&quot; But another
spectacular performance now drove the German
manoeuvre out of everybody's mind. That President
Wilson resented this German interference with his own
plans is well known; he did not drop them, however, but
on December 18th, he sent his long-contemplated peace
communication to all the warring Powers. His appeal
took the form of asking that they state the objects for
which they were fighting, the Presidential belief evidently
being that, if they did this, a common meeting ground
might possibly be found. The suggestion that the Allied
war aims were not public property, despite the fact
that British statesmen had been broadly proclaiming
them for three years, caused a momentary irritation
in England, but this was not a serious matter, especially
as the British Cabinet quickly saw that this request
gave them a position of advantage over Germany,
which had always refused to make public the terms on
which it would end the war. The main substance in this
Presidential approach, therefore, would have produced
no ill-feeling; as usual, it was a few parenthetical phrases&mdash;phrases
which were not essential to the main argument&mdash;which
set the allied countries seething with indignation.
The President, this section of his note ran, &quot;takes the
liberty of calling attention to the fact that the objects
which the statesmen of the belligerents on both sides have
in mind in this war, are virtually the same, as stated in
general terms to their own people and to the world. Each
side desires to make the rights and privileges of weak
peoples and small states as secure against aggression and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-205" id="page2-205"></a>[pg II-205]</span>
denial in the future as the rights and privileges of the
great and powerful states now at war.&quot; This idea was
elaborated in several sentences of a similar strain, the
general purport of the whole passage being that there was
little to choose between the combatants, inasmuch as both
were apparently fighting for about the same things. Mr.
Wilson's purpose in this paragraph is not obscure; he was
making his long expected appearance as a mediator, and
he evidently believed that it was essential to this r&ocirc;le that
he should not seem to be prejudiced in favour of either
side, but should hold the balance impartially between
them.</p>

<p>It is true that a minute reading indicates that Mr.
Wilson was merely quoting, or attempting to paraphrase,
the statements of the leaders of both sides, but there is such
a thing as quoting with approval, and no explanation
could convince the British public that the ruler of the
greatest neutral nation had not declared that the Allies
and the Central Powers stood morally upon the same level.
The popular indignation which this caused in Great
Britain was so intense that it alarmed the British authorities.
The publication of this note in the British press was
withheld for several hours, in order to give the Government
an opportunity to control the expression of editorial
opinion; otherwise it was feared that this would be so unrestrained
in its bitterness that relations with the United
States might be imperilled. The messages which the London
correspondents were permitted to send to the United
States were carefully censored for the same reason. The
dispatch sent by the Associated Press was the product of
a long struggle between the Foreign Office and its London
correspondent. The representatives spent half an hour
considering whether the American correspondents could
cable their country that the note had been received in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-206" id="page2-206"></a>[pg II-206]</span>
England with &quot;surprise and irritation.&quot; After much
discussion it was decided that &quot;irritation&quot; could not be
used, and the message of the Associated Press, after undergoing
this careful editing by the Foreign Office, was a
weak and ridiculous description of the high state of excitement
which prevailed in Great Britain. The fact that
the British Foreign Office should have given all this trouble
over the expressions sent to American newspapers and
should even have spent half an hour debating whether a
particular word should be used, almost pathetically illustrates
the great care taken by the British Government not
to influence American opinion against the Allies.</p>

<p>The Government took the same precautions with its
own press in England. When the note was finally
released the Foreign Office explicitly directed the London
newspapers to comment with the utmost caution
and in no case to question the President's sincerity.
Most of them acquiesced in these instructions by maintaining
silence. There was only one London newspaper,
the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>, which made even a faint-hearted
attempt to explain away the President's statement.
From the first day of the war the British people had
declared that President Wilson did not understand the
issues at stake; and they now declared that this note
confirmed their worst forebodings. The comments of
the man-in-the-street were unprintable, but more serious
than these was the impression which Mr. Wilson's dubious
remarks made upon those Englishmen who had
always been especially friendly to the United States and
who had even defended the President in previous crises.
Lord Bryce, who had accepted philosophically the Presidential
statement that the United States was not &quot;concerned
with the causes&quot; of the war, could not regard
so indulgently this latest judgment of Great Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-207" id="page2-207"></a>[pg II-207]</span>
and Germany. &quot;Bryce came to see me in a state of
great depression,&quot; wrote Page. &quot;He has sent Mr. Wilson
a personal letter on this matter.&quot; Northcliffe commanded
his newspapers, the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
to discuss the note in a judicial spirit, but he himself
told Mr. Page that &quot;everybody is as angry as hell.&quot;
When someone attempted to discuss the Wilson note
with Mr. Asquith, he brushed the subject away with a
despairing gesture. &quot;Don't talk to me about it,&quot; he
said. &quot;It is most disheartening.&quot; But the one man in
England who was perhaps the most affected was King
George. A man who had attended luncheon at Buckingham
Palace on December 21st gave Page a description
of the royal distress. The King, expressing his
surprise and dismay that Mr. Wilson should think that
Englishmen were fighting for the same things in this war
as the Germans, broke down.</p>

<p>The world only now understands the dreadful prospect
which was opening before Europe at the moment when
this Presidential note added a new cause for general
despondency. Rumania had collapsed, the first inkling
of the Russian revolution had been obtained, the
British well knew that the submarine warfare was to
be resumed, and British finances were also in a
desperate plight. More and more it was becoming
evident to the British statesmen that they needed the
intervention of the United States. This is the reason
why they could not destroy the chances of American
help by taking official offense even at what Page, in a
communication to the Secretary of State, did not hesitate
to call President Wilson's &quot;insulting words&quot;; and hence
their determination to silence the press and to give no
outward expression of what they felt. Page's interview
with Lord Robert Cecil on December 26th, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-208" id="page2-208"></a>[pg II-208]</span>
Presidential communication was lying on his desk,
discloses the real emotions of Englishmen. Apparently
Page's frank cables concerning the reception of this paragraph
had caused a certain interest in the State Department;
at least the Ambassador was instructed to call at the
Foreign Office and explain that the interpretation which
had been commonly put upon the President's words was
not the one which he had intended. At the same time
Page was instructed to request the British Foreign Office,
in case its reply were &quot;favourable,&quot; not to publish it,
but to communicate it secretly to the American Government.
The purpose of this request is a little obscure;
possibly it was the President's plan to use such a favourable
reply to force Germany likewise to display an acquiescent
mood. The object of Page's call was to present
this disclaimer.</p>

<p>Lord Robert Cecil, the son of the late Lord Salisbury,&mdash;that
same Lord Salisbury whose combats with Secretary
Blaine and Secretary Olney form piquant chapters
in British-American history&mdash;is one of the most able
and respected of British statesmen. In his earlier
life Lord Salisbury had been somewhat overbearing
in his attitude toward the United States; in his later
years, however, perhaps owing to the influence of his
nephew, Mr. Balfour, his manner had changed. In his
attitude toward the United States Lord Robert Cecil
reflected only the later phases of his father's career.
To this country and to its peaceful ideals he had always
been extremely sympathetic, and to Page especially he
had never manifested anything but cordiality. Yet it
was evident, as Page came into his office this morning,
that to Lord Robert, as to every member of the Government,
the President's note, with its equivocal phrases,
had been a terrible shock. His manner was extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-209" id="page2-209"></a>[pg II-209]</span>
courteous, as always, but he made no attempt to conceal
his feelings. Ordinarily Lord Robert did not wear his
emotions on the surface; but he took occasion on this
visit to tell Page how greatly the President's communication
had grieved him.</p>

<p>&quot;The President,&quot; he said, &quot;has seemed to pass judgment
on the allied cause by putting it on the same level
as the German. I am deeply hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>Page conveyed Mr. Lansing's message that no such
inference was justified. But this was not reassuring.</p>

<p>&quot;Moreover,&quot; Lord Robert added, &quot;there is one sentence
in the note&mdash;that in which the President says that
the position of neutrals is becoming intolerable&mdash;that
seems almost a veiled threat.&quot;</p>

<p>Page hastened to assure Lord Robert that no threat
was intended.</p>

<p>Lord Robert's manner became increasingly serious.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing that the American Government or
any other human power can do,&quot; he remarked slowly and
solemnly, &quot;which will bring this war to a close before the
Allies have spent their utmost force to secure a victory.
A failure to secure such a victory will leave the world at
the mercy of the most arrogant and the bloodiest tyranny
that has ever been organized. It is far better to die in
an effort to defeat that tyranny than to perish under its
success.&quot;</p>

<p>On any occasion Lord Robert is an impressive or at
least a striking and unusual figure; he is tall, lank, and
ungainly, almost Lincolnesque in the carelessness of his
apparel and the exceeding awkwardness of his postures and
manners. His angular features, sharp nose, pale face, and
dark hair suggest the strain of ascetism, almost of fanaticism,
which runs in the present generation of his family.
And the deep sincerity and power of his words on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-210" id="page2-210"></a>[pg II-210]</span>
occasion made an impression which Page never forgot;
they transformed the British statesman into an eloquent,
almost an heroic figure. If we are to understand the full
tragedy of this moment we must remember that, incredible
as it now seems, there was a fear in British officialdom
that the United States might not only not pursue a course
favourable to the Allies, but that it might even throw its
support to Germany. The fear, of course, was baseless;
any suggestion of such a policy in the United States would
have destroyed any official who had brought it forward;
but Lord Robert knew and Page knew that there were
insidious influences at work at that time, both in the
United States and in Great Britain, which looked in this
direction. A group of Americans, whom Page used to refer
to as &quot;peace spies,&quot; were associated with English
pacifists, for the purpose of bringing about peace on almost
any terms. These &quot;peace spies&quot; had worked out a
programme all their own. The purpose was to compel
Great Britain to accept the German terms for ending the
war. Unless she did accept them, then it was intended
that the American Government should place an embargo
on the shipment of foodstuffs and munitions to the Allies.
There is little question that the United States, by taking
such action, could have ended the war almost instantaneously.
Should the food of her people and the great
quantities of munitions which were coming from this
country be suddenly cut off, there is little likelihood that
Great Britain could have long survived. The possibility
that an embargo might shut out these supplies had hung
over the heads of British statesmen ever since the war began;
they knew that the possession of this mighty power
made the United States the potential dictator of events;
and the fear that it might be used had never ceased to
influence their thoughts or their actions. Even while this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-211" id="page2-211"></a>[pg II-211]</span>
interview was taking place, certain anti-British forces in
the United States, such as Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia,
were urging action of this kind.</p>

<p>&quot;I have always been almost a Pacifist,&quot; Lord Robert
continued. &quot;No man has ever hated war worse than I.
No man has ever had a more earnest faith that war can
be abolished. But European civilization has been murderously
assaulted and there is nothing now to do but to
defeat this desperate enemy or to perish in the effort. I
had hoped that the United States understood what is at
stake.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Robert went on:</p>

<p>&quot;I will go so far as to say that if the United States will
come into the war it will decide which will win, freedom or
organized tyranny. If the United States shall help the
Germans, civilization will perish and it will be necessary
to build it up slowly again&mdash;if indeed it will ever appear
again. If the United States will help the Allies, civilization
will triumph<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50" /><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>As to the proposal that the British terms should be
conveyed confidentially to Mr. Wilson, Lord Robert said
that that would be a difficult thing to do. The President's
note had been published, and it therefore seemed necessary
that the reply should also be given to the press. This
was the procedure that was ultimately adopted.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Startling as was the sensation caused by the President's
December note, it was mild compared with that which was
now to come. Page naturally sent prompt reports of all
these conversations to the President and likewise kept
him completely informed as to the state of public feeling,
but his best exertions apparently did not immediately
affect the Wilson policy. The overwhelming fact is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-212" id="page2-212"></a>[pg II-212]</span>
the President's mind was fixed on a determination to compel
the warring powers to make peace and in this way to
keep the United States out of the conflict. Even the disturbance
caused by his note of December 18th did not
make him pause in this peace campaign. To that note
the British sent a manly and definite reply, drafted by
Mr. Balfour, giving in detail precisely the terms upon
which the Allies would compose their differences with the
Central Powers. The Germans sent a reply consisting of
ten or a dozen lines, which did not give their terms, but
merely asked again for a conference. Events were now
moving with the utmost rapidity. On January 9th, a
council of German military chieftains was held at Pless;
in this it was decided to resume unrestricted submarine
warfare. On January 16th the Zimmermann-Mexico telegram
was intercepted; this informed Bernstorff, among
other things, that this decision had been made. On
January 16th, at nine o'clock in the morning, the
American Embassy in London began receiving a long
cipher despatch from Washington. The preamble announced
that the despatch contained a copy of an address
which the President proposed to deliver before the Senate
&quot;in a few days.&quot; Page was directed to have copies of
the address &quot;secretly prepared&quot; and to hand them to the
British Foreign Office and to newspapers of the type of the
Nation, the Daily News, and the Manchester Guardian&mdash;all
three newspapers well known for their Pacifist tendencies.
As the speech approached its end, this sentence appeared:
&quot;It must be a peace without victory.&quot; The
words greatly puzzled the secretary in charge, for they
seemed almost meaningless. Suspecting that an error
had been made in transmission, the secretary directed the
code room to cable Washington for a verification of the
cipher groups. Very soon the answer was received; there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-213" id="page2-213"></a>[pg II-213]</span>
had been no mistake; the Presidential words were precisely
those which had been first received: &quot;Peace without victory.&quot;
The slips were then taken to Page, who read the
document, especially these fateful syllables, with a consternation
which he made no effort to conceal. He immediately
wrote a cable to President Wilson, telling him of
the deplorable effect this sentence would produce and imploring
him to cut it out of his speech&mdash;with what success
the world now knows.</p>

<p>An astonishing feature of this episode is that Page had
recently explained to the Foreign Office, in obedience to
instructions from Washington, that Mr. Wilson's December
note should not be interpreted as placing the Allies and
the Central Powers on the same moral level. Now Mr.
Wilson, in this &quot;peace without victory&quot; phrase, had repeated
practically the same idea in another form. On
the day the speech was received at the Embassy, about a
week before it was delivered in the Senate, Page made
the following memorandum:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The President's address to the Senate, which was received
to-day (January 16th)<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51" /><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, shows that he thinks he
can play peace-maker. He does not at all understand,
(or, if he do, so much the worse for him) that the Entente
Powers, especially Great Britain and France, cannot make
&quot;peace without victory.&quot; If they do, they will become
vassals of Germany. In a word, the President does not
know the Germans; and he is, unconsciously, under their
influence in his thought. His speech plays into their
hands.</p>

<p>This address will give great offense in England, since it
puts each side in the war on the same moral level.</p>

<p>I immediately saw the grave danger to our relations with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-214" id="page2-214"></a>[pg II-214]</span>
Great Britain by the Peace-without-Victory plan; and I
telegraphed the President, venturing to advise him to omit
that phrase&mdash;with no result.</p></div>

<p>Afterward Page added this to the above:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Compare this Senate speech with his speech in April
calling for war: Just when and how did the President
come to see the true nature of the German? What made
him change from Peace-Maker to War-Maker? The
Zimmermann telegram, or the February U-boat renewal
of warfare? Had he been so credulous as to believe the
German promise? This promise had been continuously
and repeatedly broken.</p>

<p>Or was it the pressure of public opinion, the growing
impatience of the people that pushed him in?</p>

<p>This distressing peace-move&mdash;utterly out of touch with
the facts of the origin of the war or of its conduct or of the
mood and necessities of Great Britain&mdash;a remote, academic
deliverance, while Great Britain and France were
fighting for their very lives&mdash;made a profoundly dejected
feeling; and it made my place and work more uncomfortable
than ever. &quot;Peace without victory&quot; brought us to
the very depths of European disfavour.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI" />CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES AT WAR</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The United States broke off diplomatic relations with
Germany on February 3, 1917. The occasion was
a memorable one in the American Embassy in London,
not unrelieved by a touch of the ridiculous. All day
long a nervous and rather weary company had waited in
the Ambassador's room for the decisive word from Washington.
Mr. and Mrs. Page, Mr. and Mrs. Laughlin, Mr.
Shoecraft, the Ambassador's secretary, sat there hour after
hour, hardly speaking to one another in their tense excitement,
waiting for the news that would inform them that
Bernstorff's course had been run and that their country
had taken its decision on the side of the Allies. Finally,
at nine o'clock in the evening, the front door bell rang.
Mr. Shoecraft excitedly left the room; half way downstairs
he met Admiral William Reginald Hall, the head
of the British Naval Intelligence, who was hurrying up to
the Ambassador. Admiral Hall, as he spied Mr. Shoecraft,
stopped abruptly and uttered just two words:</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God!&quot;</p>

<p>He then went into the Ambassador's room and read a
secret code message which he had just received from Captain
Gaunt, the British naval attach&eacute; at Washington.
It was as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Bernstorff has just been given his passports. I shall
probably get drunk to-night!&quot;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-216" id="page2-216"></a>[pg II-216]</span></div>
<p>It was in this way that Page first learned that the long
tension had passed.</p>

<p>Page well understood that the dismissal of Bernstorff
at that time meant war with the Central Empires. Had
this dismissal taken place in 1915, after the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, or in 1916, after the sinking of the <i>Sussex</i>, Page
believed that a simple break in relations would in itself
have brought the war to an early end. But by February,
1917, things had gone too far. For Germany had now
decided to stake everything upon the chance of winning a
quick victory with the submarine. Our policy had persuaded
the Kaiser's advisers that America would not
intervene; and the likelihood of rapidly starving Great
Britain was so great&mdash;indeed the Germans had reduced the
situation to a mathematical calculation of success&mdash;that
an American declaration of war seemed to Berlin to be a
matter of no particular importance. The American Ambassador
in London regarded Bernstorff's dismissal much
more seriously. It justified the interpretations of events
which he had been sending to Mr. Wilson, Colonel House,
and others for nearly three years. If Page had been inclined
to take satisfaction in the fulfilment of his own prophecies,
Germany's disregard of her promises and the
American declaration of war would have seemed an ample
justification of his course as ambassador.</p>

<p>But Page had little time for such vain communings.
&quot;All that water,&quot; as he now wrote, &quot;has flowed over the
dam.&quot; Occasionally his mind would revert to the dreadful
period of &quot;neutrality,&quot; but in the main his activities,
mental and physical, were devoted to the future. A
letter addressed to his son Arthur shows how quickly and
how sympathetically he was adjusting himself to the
new prospect. His mind was now occupied with ships,
food, armies, warfare on submarines, and the approaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-217" id="page2-217"></a>[pg II-217]</span>
resettlement of the world. How completely he foresaw
the part that the United States must play in the actual
waging of hostilities, and to what an extent he himself was
responsible for the policies that ultimately prevailed, appears
in this letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Arthur W. Page</i><br />
<br />
25 March, 1917, London.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>It's very hard, not to say impossible, to write in these
swiftly moving days. Anything written to-day is out of
date to-morrow&mdash;even if it be not wrong to start with.
The impression becomes stronger here every day that we
shall go into the war &quot;with both feet&quot;&mdash;that the people
have pushed the President over in spite of his vision of the
Great Peacemaker, and that, being pushed over, his idea
now will be to show how he led them into a glorious war
in defense of democracy. That's my reading of the situation,
and I hope I am not wrong. At any rate, ever since
the call of Congress for April 2nd, I have been telegraphing
tons of information and plans that can be of use only
if we go to war. Habitually they never acknowledge the
receipt of anything at Washington. I don't know, therefore,
whether they like these pieces of information or not.
I have my staff of twenty-five good men getting all sorts
of warlike information; and I have just organized twenty-five
or thirty more&mdash;the best business Americans in
London&mdash;who are also at work. I am trying to get the
Government at Washington to send over a committee of
conference&mdash;a General, an Admiral, a Reserve Board man,
etc., etc. If they do half the things that I recommend
we'll be in at the final lickin' big, and will save our souls
yet.</p>

<p>There's lots of human nature in this world. A note is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-218" id="page2-218"></a>[pg II-218]</span>
now sometimes heard here in undertone (Northcliffe strikes
it)&mdash;that they don't want the Americans in the war.
This means that if we come in just as the Allies finish the
job we'll get credit, in part, for the victory, which we did
little to win! But that's a minor note. The great mass
of people do want us in, quick, hard, and strong&mdash;our
money and our guns and our ships.</p>

<p>A gift of a billion dollars<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52" /><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to France will fix Franco-American
history all right for several centuries. Push it
through. Such a gift could come to this Kingdom also
but for the British stupidity about the Irish for three
hundred years. A big loan to Great Britain at a low
rate of interest will do the work here.</p>

<p>My mind keeps constantly on the effect of the war and
especially of our action on our own country. Of course
that is the most important end of the thing for us. I hope
that&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It will break up and tear away our isolation;</p>

<p>2. It will unhorse our cranks and soft-brains.</p>

<p>3. It will make us less promiscuously hospitable to
every kind of immigrant;</p>

<p>4. It will re&euml;stablish in our minds and conscience and
policy our true historic genesis, background, kindred, and
destiny&mdash;i.e., kill the Irish and the German influence.</p>

<p>5. It will revive our real manhood&mdash;put the molly-coddles
in disgrace, as idiots and dandies are;</p>

<p>6. It will make our politics frank and manly by restoring
our true nationality;</p>

<p>7. It will make us again a great sea-faring people. It
is this that has given Great Britain its long lead in the
world;</p>

<p>8. Break up our feminized education&mdash;make a boy a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-219" id="page2-219"></a>[pg II-219]</span>
vigorous animal and make our education rest on a wholesome
physical basis;</p>

<p>9. Bring men of a higher type into our political life.</p>

<p>We need waking up and shaking up and invigorating as
much as the Germans need taking down.</p>

<p>There is no danger of &quot;militarism&quot; in any harmful sense
among any English race or in any democracy.</p>

<p>By George! all these things open an interesting outlook
and series of tasks&mdash;don't they?</p>

<p>My staff and I are asking everybody what the Americans
can best do to help the cause along. The views are
not startling, but they are interesting.</p>

<p><i>Jellicoe</i>: More ships, merchant ships, any kind of
ships, and take over the patrol of the American side of the
Atlantic and release the British cruisers there.</p>

<p><i>Balfour</i>: American credits in the United States big
enough to keep up the rate of exchange.</p>

<p><i>Bonar Law</i>: Same thing.</p>

<p><i>The military men</i>: An expeditionary force, no matter
how small, for the effect of the American Flag in Europe.
If one regiment marched through London and Paris and
took the Flag to the front, that would be worth the winning
of a battle.</p>

<p>Think of the vast increase of territory and power Great
Britain will have&mdash;her colonies drawn closer than ever, the
German colonies, or most of them, taken over by her, Bagdad
hers&mdash;what a way Germany chose to lessen the British
Empire! And these gains of territory will be made,
as most of her gains have been, not by any prearranged, set
plan, but as by-products of action for some other purpose.
The only people who have made a deliberate plan to conquer
the earth&mdash;now living&mdash;are the Germans. And from
first to last the additions to the British Empire have been
made because she has been a first-class maritime power.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-220" id="page2-220"></a>[pg II-220]</span>
<p>And that's the way she has made her trade and her money,
too.</p>

<p>On top of this the President speculates about the danger
of the white man losing his supremacy because a few million
men get killed! The truth is every country that is
playing a big part in the war was overpopulated. There
will be a considerable productive loss because the killed
men were, as a rule, the best men; but the white man's
control of the world hasn't depended on any few million
of males. This speculation is far up in the clouds. If
Russia and Germany really be liberated from social and
political and industrial autocracy, this liberation will
bring into play far more power than all the men killed in
the war could have had under the pre-war r&eacute;gime. I observe
this with every year of my observation&mdash;there's no
substitute for common-sense.</p>

<p>The big results of the war will, after all, be the freedom
and the stimulation of men in these weary Old-World
lands&mdash;in Russia, Germany itself, and in England. In five
or ten years (or sooner, alas!) the dead will be forgotten.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a picture of the world as it will be
when the war ends, you must conjure up such scenes as
these&mdash;human bones along the Russian highways where
the great retreat took place and all that such a sight denotes;
Poland literally starved; Serbia, blasted and burned
and starved; Armenia butchered; the horrible tragedy of
Gallipoli, where the best soldiers in the world were sacrificed
to politicians' policies; Austria and Germany starved and
whipped but liberalized&mdash;perhaps no king in either country;
Belgium&mdash;belgiumized; northern France the same
and worse; more productive Frenchmen killed in proportion
to the population perhaps than any other country
will have lost; Great Britain&mdash;most of her best men gone
or maimed; colossal debts; several Teutonic countries bankrupt;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-221" id="page2-221"></a>[pg II-221]</span>
every atrocity conceivable committed somewhere&mdash;a
hell-swept great continent having endured more suffering
in three years than in the preceding three hundred.
Then, ten years later, most of this suffering a mere memory;
governments reorganized and liberalized; men made
more efficient by this strenuous three years' work; the
fields got back their bloom, and life going on much as it
did before&mdash;with this chief difference&mdash;some kings have
gone and many privileges have been abolished. The
lessons are two&mdash;(1) that no government can successfully
set out and conquer the world; and (2) that the hold that
privilege holders acquire costs more to dislodge than any
one could ever have guessed. That's the sum of it. Kings
and privilege mongers, of course, have held the parts of
the world separate from one another. They fatten on
provincialism, which is mistaken for patriotism. As
they lose their grip, human sympathy has its natural play
between nations, and civilization has a chance. With any
Emperor of Germany left the war will have been half in
vain.</p>

<p>If we (the U.S.A.) cultivate the manly qualities and
throw off our cranks and read our own history and be true
to our traditions and blood and get some political vigour;
then if we emancipate ourselves from the isolation theory
and from the landlubber theory&mdash;get into the world and
build ships, ships, ships, ships, and run them to the ends of
the seas, we can dominate the world in trade and in political
thought.</p>

<p>You know I have moments when it occurs to me that
perhaps I'd better give whatever working years I may
have to telling this story&mdash;the story of the larger meaning of
the war. There's no bigger theme&mdash;never was one so big.</p></div>

<p>On April 1st, the day before President Wilson made his
great address before Congress requesting that body to declare
the existence of a state of war with Germany, Page
committed to paper a few paragraphs which summed up
his final judgment of President Wilson's foreign policy for
the preceding two and a half years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
Embassy of the United States of America,<br />

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In these last days, before the United States is forced
into war&mdash;by the people's insistence&mdash;the preceding course
of events becomes even clearer than it was before; and it
has been as clear all the time as the nose on a man's face.</p>

<p>The President began by refusing to understand the
meaning of the war. To him it seemed a quarrel to settle
economic rivalries between Germany and England. He
said to me last September<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53" /><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> that there were many causes
why Germany went to war. He showed a great degree
of toleration for Germany; and he was, during the whole
morning that I talked with him, complaining of England.
The controversies we had with England were, of course,
mere by-products of the conflict. But to him they
seemed as important as the controversy we had with Germany.
In the beginning he had made&mdash;as far as it was
possible&mdash;neutrality a positive quality of mind. He would
not move from that position.</p>

<p>That was his first error of judgment. And by insisting
on this he soothed the people&mdash;sat them down in comfortable
chairs and said, &quot;Now stay there.&quot; He really
suppressed speech and thought.</p>

<p>The second error he made was in thinking that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-223" id="page2-223"></a>[pg II-223]</span>
play a great part as peacemaker&mdash;come and give a blessing
to these erring children. This was strong in his hopes and
ambitions. There was a condescension in this attitude
that was offensive.</p>

<p>He shut himself up with these two ideas and engaged
in what he called &quot;thought.&quot; The air currents of the
world never ventilated his mind.</p>

<p>This inactive position he has kept as long as public sentiment
permitted. He seems no longer to regard himself
nor to speak as a leader&mdash;only as the mouthpiece of public
opinion after opinion has run over him.</p>

<p>He has not breathed a spirit into the people: he has
encouraged them to supineness. He is <i>not</i> a leader, but
rather a stubborn phrasemaker.</p>

<p>And now events and the aroused people seem to have
brought the President to the necessary point of action;
and even now he may act timidly.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;One thing pleases me,&quot; Page wrote to his son Arthur,
&quot;I never lost faith in the American people. It is now
clear that I was right in feeling that they would have
gladly come in any time after the <i>Lusitania</i> crime. Middle
West in the front, and that the German hasn't made any
real impression on the American nation. He was made
a bug-a-boo and worked for all he was worth by Bernstorff;
and that's the whole story. We are as Anglo-Saxon
as we ever were. If Hughes had had sense and
courage enough to say: 'I'm for war, war to save our
honour and to save democracy,' he would now be President.
If Wilson had said that, Hughes would have carried no
important states in the Union. The suppressed people
would have risen to either of them. That's God's truth as
I believe it. The real United States is made up of you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-224" id="page2-224"></a>[pg II-224]</span>
and Frank and the Page boys at Aberdeen and of the
10,000,000 other young fellows who are ready to do the
job and who instinctively see the whole truth of the situation.
But of course what the people would not have done
under certain conditions&mdash;that water also has flowed over
the dam; and I mention it only because I have resolutely
kept my faith in the people and there has been nothing in
recent events that has shaken it.&quot;</p>

<p>Two letters which Page wrote on this same April 1st
are interesting in that they outline almost completely the
war policy that was finally carried out:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR EFFENDI:</p>

<p>Here's the programme:</p>

<p>(1) Our navy in immediate action in whatever way a
conference with the British shows we can best help.</p>

<p>(2) A small expeditionary force to France immediately&mdash;as
large as we can quickly make ready, if only
10,000 men&mdash;as proof that we are ready to do some fighting.</p>

<p>(3) A large expeditionary force as soon as the men can
be organized and equipped. They can be trained into an
effective army in France in about one fourth of the time
that they could be trained anywhere else.</p>

<p>(4) A large loan to the Allies at a low rate of interest.</p>

<p>(5) Ships, ships, ships&mdash;troop ships, food ships, munition
ships, auxiliary ships to the navy, wooden ships, steel
ships, little ships, big ships, ships, ships, ships without
number or end.</p>

<p>(6) A clear-cut expression of the moral issue involved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-225" id="page2-225"></a>[pg II-225]</span>
in the war. Every social and political ideal that we
stand for is at stake. If we value democracy in the
world, this is the chance to further it or&mdash;to bring it into
utter disrepute. After Russia must come Germany and
Austria; and then the King-business will pretty nearly be
put out of commission.</p>

<p>(7) We must go to war in dead earnest. We must
sign the Allies' agreement not to make a separate peace,
and we must stay in to the end. Then the end will be
very greatly hastened.</p>

<p>It's been four years ago to-day since I was first asked to
come here. God knows I've done my poor best to save
our country and to help. It'll be four years in the middle
of May since I sailed. I shall still do my best. I'll not be
able to start back by May 15th, but I have a feeling, if
we do our whole duty in the United States, that the end
may not be very many months off. And how long off it
may be may depend to a considerable degree on our action.</p>

<p>We are faring very well on army rations. None of us
will live to see another time when so many big things are
at stake nor another time when our country can play so
large or important a part in saving the world. Hold up
your end. I'm doing my best here.</p>

<p>I think of you engaged in the peaceful work of instructing
the people, and I think of the garden and crocuses and
the smell of early spring in the air and the earth and&mdash;push
on; I'll be with you before we grow much older or
get much grayer; and a great and prosperous and peaceful
time will lie before us. Pity me and hold up your end for
real American participation. Get together? Yes; but
the way to get together is to get in!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR HOUSTON:</p>

<p>The Administration can save itself from becoming a
black blot on American history only by vigorous action&mdash;acts
such as these:</p>

<p>Putting our navy to work&mdash;vigorous work&mdash;wherever
and however is wisest. I have received the Government's
promise to send an Admiral here at once for a conference.
We must work out with the British Navy a programme
whereby we can best help; and we must carry it without
hesitancy or delay.</p>

<p>Sending over an expeditionary military force immediately&mdash;a
small one, but as large as we can, as an earnest
of a larger one to come. This immediate small one will
have a good moral effect; and we need all the moral reinstatement
that we can get in the estimation of the world;
our moral stock is lower than, I fear, any of you at home
can possibly realize. As for a larger expeditionary force
later&mdash;even that ought to be sent quite early. It can and
must spend some time in training in France, whatever its
training beforehand may have been. All the military men
agree that soldiers in France back of the line can be trained
in at least half the time that they can be trained
anywhere else. The officers at once take their turn in the
trenches, and the progress that they and their men make in
close proximity to the fighting is one of the remarkable discoveries
of the war. The British Army was so trained
and all the colonial forces. Two or three or four hundred
thousand Americans could be sent over as soon almost as
they are organized and equipped-provided transports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-227" id="page2-227"></a>[pg II-227]</span>
and a continuous supply of food and munition ships can
be got. They can be trained into fighting men&mdash;into an
effective army&mdash;in about one third of the time that would
be required at home.</p>

<p>I suppose, of course, we shall make at once a large
loan to the Allies at a low rate of interest. That is most
important, but that alone will not save us. We must also
<i>fight</i>.</p>

<p>All the ships we can get&mdash;build, requisition, or confiscate&mdash;are
needed immediately.</p>

<p>Navy, army, money, ships&mdash;these are the first things,
but by no means all. We must make some expression of
a conviction that there is a moral question of right and
wrong involved in this war&mdash;a question of humanity, a
question of democracy. So far we have (officially) spoken
only of the wrongs done to our ships and citizens. Deep
wrongs have been done to all our moral ideas, to our
ideals. We have sunk very low in European opinion because
we do not seem to know even yet that a German
victory would be less desirable than (say) a Zulu victory
of the world.</p>

<p>We must go in with the Allies, not begin a mere single
fight against submarines. We must sign the pact of
London&mdash;not make a separate peace.</p>

<p>We mustn't longer spin dreams about peace, nor
leagues to enforce peace, nor the Freedom of the Seas.
These things are mere intellectual diversions of minds
out of contact with realities. Every political and social
ideal we have is at stake. If we make them secure, we'll
save Europe from destruction and save ourselves, too.
I pray for vigour and decision and clear-cut resolute action.</p>

<p>(1) The Navy&mdash;full strength, no &quot;grapejuice&quot; action.</p>

<p>(2) An immediate expeditionary force.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-228" id="page2-228"></a>[pg II-228]</span>
<p>(3) A larger expeditionary force very soon.</p>

<p>(4) A large loan at a low interest.</p>

<p>(5) Ships, ships, ships.</p>

<p>(6) A clear-cut expression of the moral issue. Thus
(and only thus) can we swing into a new era, with a world
born again.</p></div>

<p>A memorandum, written on April 3rd, the day after
President Wilson advised Congress to declare a state of
war with Germany:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Day</i></p>

<p>When I went to see Mr. Balfour to-day he shook my
hand warmly and said: &quot;It's a great day for the world.&quot;
And so has everybody said, in one way or another, that I
have met to-day.</p>

<p>The President's speech did not appear in the morning
papers&mdash;only a very brief summary in one or two of them;
but the meaning of it was clear. The fact that the House
of Representatives organized itself in one day and that
the President addressed Congress on the evening of that
day told the story. The noon papers had the President's
speech in full; and everybody applauds.</p>

<p>My &quot;Cabinet&quot; meeting this morning was unusually
interesting; and the whole group has never before been
so delighted. I spoke of the suggestive, constructive
work we have already done in making reports on various
war preparations and activities of this kingdom. &quot;Now
we have greater need than ever, every man to do constructive
work&mdash;to think of plans to serve. We are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-229" id="page2-229"></a>[pg II-229]</span>
this excellent strategical position in the capital of the
greatest belligerent&mdash;a position which I thank my stars,
the President, and all the powers that be for giving us.
We can each strive to justify our existence.&quot;</p>

<p>Few visitors called; but enthusiastic letters have begun
to come in.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole afternoon was spent with Mr. Balfour
and Lord Robert Cecil. Mr. Balfour had a long list of
subjects. Could we help in (1)&mdash;(2)&mdash;(3)?&mdash;Every once
in a while he stopped his enumeration of subjects long
enough to tell me how the action of the United States had
moved him.</p>

<p>To Lord Robert I said: &quot;I pray you, give the Black
List a decent burial: It's dead now, but through no act of
yours. It insulted every American because you did not
see that it was insulting: that's the discouraging fact to
me.&quot; He thanked me earnestly. He'll think about that.</p></div>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>These jottings give only a faint impression of the
change which the American action wrought in Page. The
strain which he had undergone for twenty-nine months
had been intense; it had had the most unfortunate effect
upon his health; and the sudden lifting might have produced
that reaction for the worse which is not unusual
after critical experiences of this kind. But the gratification
which Page felt in the fact that the American spirit
had justified his confidence gave him almost a certain
exuberance of contentment. Londoners who saw him at
that time describe him as acting like a man from whose
shoulders a tremendous weight had suddenly been removed.
For more than two years Page had been compelled,
officially at least, to assume a &quot;neutrality&quot; with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-230" id="page2-230"></a>[pg II-230]</span>
which he had never had the slightest sympathy, but the
necessity for this mask now no longer existed. A well-known
Englishman happened to meet Page leaving his
house in Grosvenor Square the day after the Declaration
of War. He stopped and shook the Ambassador's hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God,&quot; the Englishman said, &quot;that there is one
hypocrite less in London to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Page.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean you. Pretending all this time that you were
neutral! That isn't necessary any longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are right!&quot; the Ambassador answered as he
walked on with a laugh and a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>A few days after the Washington Declaration, the American
Luncheon Club held a feast in honour of the event.
This organization had a membership of representative
American business men in London, but its behaviour during
the war had not been based upon Mr. Wilson's idea of
neutrality. Indeed its tables had so constantly rung with
denunciations of the <i>Lusitania</i> notes that all members
of the American Embassy, from Page down, had found
it necessary to refrain from attending its proceedings.
When Page arose to address his compatriots on this occasion,
therefore, he began with the significant words, &quot;I am
glad to be back with you again,&quot; and the mingled laughter
and cheers with which this remark was received indicated
that his hearers had caught the point.</p>

<p>The change took place not only in Page, but in London
and the whole of Great Britain. An England that had been
saying harsh things of the United States for nearly two
years now suddenly changed its attitude. Both houses
of Parliament held commemorative sessions in honour
of America's participation; in the Commons Mr. Lloyd
George, Mr. Asquith, and other leaders welcomed their
new allies, and in the Upper Chamber Lord Curzon, Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-231" id="page2-231"></a>[pg II-231]</span>
Bryce, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and others similarly
voiced their admiration. The Stars and Stripes almost
instantaneously broke out on private dwellings, shops,
hotels, and theatres; street hucksters did a thriving business
selling rosettes of the American colours, which even
the most stodgy Englishmen did not disdain to wear in
their buttonholes; wherever there was a band or an orchestra,
the Star Spangled Banner acquired a sudden
popularity; and the day even came when the American
and the British flags flew side by side over the Houses of
Parliament&mdash;the first occasion in history that any other
than the British standard had received this honour. The
editorial outgivings of the British press on America's entrance
form a literature all their own. The theatres and
the music halls, which had found in &quot;notes&quot; and &quot;nootrality&quot;
an endless theme of entertainment for their patrons,
now sounded Americanism as their most popular refrain.
Churches and cathedrals gave special services in honour
of American intervention, and the King and the President
began to figure side by the side in the prayer book. The
estimation in which President Wilson was held changed
overnight. All the phrases that had so grieved Englishmen
were instantaneously forgotten. The President's
address before Congress was praised as one of the most
eloquent and statesmanlike utterances in history. Special
editions of this heartening document had a rapid sale; it
was read in school houses, churches, and at public gatherings,
and it became a most influential force in uplifting the
hopes of the Allies and inspiring them to renewed activities.
Americans everywhere, in the streets, at dinner
tables, and in general social intercourse, could feel the new
atmosphere of respect and admiration which had suddenly
become their country's portion. The first American
troops that passed through London&mdash;a company of engineers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-232" id="page2-232"></a>[pg II-232]</span>
an especially fine body of men&mdash;aroused a popular
enthusiasm which was almost unprecedented in a
capital not celebrated for its emotional displays. Page
himself records one particularly touching indication of the
feeling for Americans which was now universal. &quot;The
increasing number of Americans who come through England,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;most of them on their way to France,
but some of them also to serve in England, give much
pleasure to the British public&mdash;nurses, doctors, railway
engineers, sawmill units, etc. The sight of every American
uniform pleases London. The other morning a group
of American nurses gathered with the usual crowd in front
of Buckingham Palace while the Guards band played inside
the gates. Man after man as they passed them and
saw their uniforms lifted their hats.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ambassador's mail likewise underwent a complete
transformation. His correspondence of the preceding
two years, enormous in its extent, had contained much
that would have disturbed a man who could easily get
excited over trifles, but this aspect of his work never
caused Page the slightest unhappiness. Almost every
crank in England who disliked the American policy had
seemed to feel it his duty to express his opinions to the
American Ambassador. These letters, at times sorrowful,
at others abusive, even occasionally threatening, varying
in their style from cultivated English to the grossest
illiteracy, now written in red ink to emphasize their bitterness,
now printed in large block letters to preserve their
anonymity, aroused in Page only a temporary amusement.
But the letters that began to pour in upon him after our
Declaration, many of them from the highest placed men
and women in the Kingdom, brought out more vividly
than anything else the changed position of his country.
Sonnets and verses rained upon the Embassy, most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-233" id="page2-233"></a>[pg II-233]</span>
them pretty bad as poetry, but all of them commendable
for their admiring and friendly spirit. Of all these
letters those that came from the steadfast friends of America
perhaps gave Page the greatest satisfaction. &quot;You
will have been pleased at the universal tribute paid to the
spirit as well as to the lofty and impressive terms of the
President's speech,&quot; wrote Lord Bryce. &quot;Nothing finer
in our time, few things so fine.&quot; But probably the letter
which gave Page the greatest pleasure was that which
came from the statesman whose courtesy and broad outlook
had eased the Ambassador's task in the old neutrality
days. In 1916, Sir Edward Grey&mdash;now become Viscount
Grey of Fallodon&mdash;had resigned office, forced out, Page
says in one of his letters, mainly because he had refused to
push the blockade to a point where it might produce a
break with the United States. He had spent the larger
part of the time since that event at his country place in
Northumberland, along the streams and the forests which
had always given him his greatest pleasure, attempting to
recover something of the health that he had lost in the ten
years which he had spent as head of the British Foreign
Office and bearing with characteristic cheerfulness and
fortitude the tragedy of a gradually failing eyesight.
The American Declaration of War now came to Lord Grey
as the complete justification of his policy. The mainspring
of that policy, as already explained, had been a
determination to keep the friendship of the United States,
and so shape events that the support of this country
would ultimately be cast on the side of the Allies. And
now the great occasion for which he had prepared had
come, and in Grey's mind this signified more than a help
to England in soldiers and ships; it meant bringing together
the two branches of a common race for the promotion
of common ideals.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PAGE:</p>

<p>This is a line that needs no answer to express my congratulations
on President Wilson's address. I can't express
adequately all that I feel. Great gratitude and
great hope are in my heart. I hope now that some
great and abiding good to the world will yet be wrought
out of all this welter of evil. Recent events in Russia, too,
stimulate this hope: they are a good in themselves, but not
the power for good in this war that a great and firmly
established free country like the United States can be.
The President's address and the way it has been followed
up in your country is a splendid instance of great action
finely inspired. I glow with admiration.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours sincerely,<br />

GREY OF FALLODON<br />
</div>

<p>One Englishman who was especially touched by the
action of the United States was His Majesty the King.
Few men had watched the course of America during the
war with more intelligent interest than the head of the
British royal house. Page had had many interviews with
King George at Buckingham Palace and at Windsor, and
his notes contain many appreciative remarks on the King's
high character and conscientious devotion to his duties.
That Page in general did not believe in kings and emperors
as institutions his letters reveal; yet even so profound
a Republican as he recognized sterling character, whether
in a crowned head or in a humble citizen, and he had seen
enough of King George to respect him. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-235" id="page2-235"></a>[pg II-235]</span>
the peculiar limitations of the British monarchy certainly
gave it an unusual position and even saved it
from much of the criticism that was fairly lavished upon
such nations as Germany and Austria. Page especially
admired King George's frankness in recognizing these
limitations and his readiness to accommodate himself
to the British Constitution. On most occasions, when
these two men met, their intercourse was certainly friendly
or at least not formidable. After all formalities had been
exchanged, the King would frequently draw the Ambassador
aside; the two would retire to the smoking room, and
there, over their cigars, discuss a variety of matters&mdash;submarines,
international politics, the Irish question and the
like. His Majesty was not averse even to bringing up
the advantages of the democratic and the monarchical
system. The King and Ambassador would chat, as Page
himself would say, like &quot;two human beings&quot;; King
George is an emphatic and vivacious talker, fond of emphasizing
his remarks by pounding the table; he has the
liveliest sense of humour, and enjoys nothing quite so
much as a good story. Page found that, on the subject
of the Germans, the King entertained especially robust
views. &quot;They are my kinsmen,&quot; he would say, &quot;but I
am ashamed of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Probably most Englishmen, in the early days of the war,
preferred that the United States should not engage in
hostilities; even after the <i>Lusitania</i>, the majority in all
likelihood held this view. There are indications, however,
that King George favoured American participation.
A few days after the <i>Lusitania</i> sinking, Page had an audience
for the purpose of presenting a medal sent by certain
societies in New Orleans. Neither man was thinking
much about medals that morning. The thoughts uppermost
in their minds, as in the minds of most Americans and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-236" id="page2-236"></a>[pg II-236]</span>
Englishmen, were the <i>Lusitania</i> and the action that the
United States was likely to take concerning it. After the
formalities of presentation, the King asked Page to sit
down and talked with him for more than half an hour.
&quot;He said that Germany was evidently trying to force the
United States into the war; that he had no doubt we would
soon be in it and that, for his part, he would welcome us
heartily. The King also said he had reliable information
from Germany, that the Emperor had wished to return
a conciliatory answer to our <i>Lusitania</i> note, but that
Admiral von Tirpitz had prevented it, even going so far
as to 'threaten' the Kaiser. It appears that the Admiral
insisted that the submarine was the only weapon the
Germans could use with effect against England and that
they could not afford to give it up. He was violent and
the Kaiser finally yielded<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55" /><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The statement from the King at that crisis, that he
would &quot;heartily welcome the United States into the war,&quot;
was interpreted by the Ambassador as amounting practically
to an invitation&mdash;and certainly as expressing a wish
that such an intervention should take place.</p>

<p>That the American participation would rejoice King
George could therefore be taken for granted. Soon after
this event, the Ambassador and Mrs. Page were invited to
spend the night at Windsor.</p>

<p>&quot;I arrived during the middle of the afternoon,&quot; writes
Page, &quot;and he sent for me to talk with him in his office.</p>

<p>&quot;'I've a good story on you,' said he. 'You Americans
have a queer use of the word &quot;some,&quot; to express mere bigness
or emphasis. We are taking that use of the word
from you over here. Well, an American and an Englishman
were riding in the same railway compartment. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-237" id="page2-237"></a>[pg II-237]</span>
American read his paper diligently&mdash;all the details of a big
battle. When he got done, he put the paper down and said:
&quot;Some fight!&quot; &quot;And some don't!&quot; said the Englishman.'</p>

<p>&quot;And the King roared. 'A good one on you!'</p>

<p>&quot;'The trouble with that joke, sir,' I ventured to reply,
'is that it's out of date.'</p>

<p>&quot;He was in a very gay mood, surely because of our
entry into the war. After the dinner&mdash;there were no
guests except Mrs. Page and me, the members of his household,
of course, being present&mdash;he became even familiar
in the smoking room. He talked about himself and his
position as king. 'Knowing the difficulties of a limited
monarch, I thank heaven I am spared being an absolute
one.'</p>

<p>&quot;He went on to enumerate the large number of things
he was obliged to do, for example, to sign the death warrant
of every condemned man&mdash;and the little real power
that he had&mdash;not at all in a tone of complaint, but as a
merely impersonal explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Just how much power&mdash;perhaps 'influence' is a better
word&mdash;the King has, depends on his personality. The
influence of the throne&mdash;and of him on the throne, being a
wholly thoughtful, industrious, and conscientious man&mdash;is
very great&mdash;greatest of all in keeping the vested interests
of the aristocratic social structure secure.</p>

<p>&quot;Earlier than this visit to Windsor he sent for me to go
to Buckingham Palace very soon after we declared war.
He went over the whole course of events&mdash;and asked me
many questions. After I had risen and said 'good-bye'
and was about to bow myself out the door, he ran toward
me and waving his hand cried out, 'Ah&mdash;Ah!&mdash;we knew
where <i>you</i> stood all the time.'</p>

<p>&quot;When General Pershing came along on his way to
France, the King summoned us to luncheon. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-238" id="page2-238"></a>[pg II-238]</span>
luncheon was eaten (here, as everywhere, strict war rations
are observed) to a flow of general talk, with the
Queen, Princess Mary, and one of the young Princes.
When they had gone from the luncheon room, the King,
General Pershing, and I stood smoking by the window; and
the King at once launched into talk about guns, rifles,
ammunition, and the American place in the battle line.
Would our place be with the British or with the French or
between the two?</p>

<p>&quot;General Pershing made a diplomatic reply. So far as
he knew the President hadn't yet made a final decision,
but there was a feeling that, since we were helping the
British at sea, perhaps we ought to help the French on
land.</p>

<p>&quot;Then the King expressed the earnest hope that our
guns and ammunition would match either the British or
the French. Else if we happened to run out of ammunition
we could not borrow from anybody. He thought it
most unfortunate that the British and French guns and
rifles were of different calibres.&quot;</p>

<i>To Arthur W. Page</i><br />
<br />
Brighton, England,<br />
<br />
April 28, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>... Well, the British have given us a very good
welcome into the war. They are not very skillful at such
a task: they do not know how to say &quot;Welcome&quot; very
vociferously. But they have said it to the very best of
their ability. My speeches (which I send you, with
some comment) were very well received indeed. Simple
and obvious as they were, they meant a good deal of work.</p>

<p>I cannot conceal nor can I express my gratification that
we are in the war. I shall always wonder but never find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-239" id="page2-239"></a>[pg II-239]</span>
out what influence I had in driving the President over.
All I know is that my letters and telegrams for nearly
two years&mdash;especially for the last twelve months&mdash;have
put before him every reason that anybody has expressed
why we should come in&mdash;in season and out of season.
And there is no new reason&mdash;only more reason of the same
old sort&mdash;why we should have come in now than there was
why we should have come in a year ago. I suspect that the
pressure of the press and of public opinion really became
too strong for him. And, of course, the Peace-Dream
blew up&mdash;was torpedoed, mined, shot, captured, and
killed. I trust, too, much enlightenment will be furnished
by the two Commissions now in Washington<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56" /><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Yet it's
comical to think of the attitude of the poor old Department
last September and its attitude now. But thank
God for it! Every day now brings a confession of the
blank idiocy of its former course and its long argument!
Never mind that, so long as we are now right.</p>

<p>I have such a sense of relief that I almost feel that my
job is now done. Yet, I dare say, my most important
work is still to come.</p>

<p>The more I try to reach some sort of rational judgment
about the war, the more I find myself at sea. It does look
as if the very crisis is near. And there can be no doubt
now&mdash;not even, I hope, in the United States&mdash;about the
necessity of a clear and decisive victory, nor about
punishment. All the devastation of Northern France,
which outbarbarizes barbarism, all the ships sunk, including
hospital ships, must be paid for; that's all. There'll
be famine in Europe whenever it end. Not only must
these destructions be paid for, but the Hohenzollerns and
all they stand for must go. Trust your Frenchman for
that, if nobody else!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-240" id="page2-240"></a>[pg II-240]</span>
<p>If Europe had the food wasted in the United States,
it would make the difference between sustenance and
famine. By the way, the submarine has made every
nation a danger zone except those few that have self-feeding
continents, such as ours. It can bring famine
to any other kind of a country.</p>

<p>You are now out in the country again&mdash;good. Give
Mollie my love and help her with the garden. I envy
you the fresh green things to eat. Little Mollie, kiss
her for granddaddy. The Ambassador, I suppose, waxes
even sturdier, and I'm glad to hear that A.W.P., Jr., is
picking up. Get him fed right at all costs. If Frank
stays at home and Ralph and his family come up, you'll
all have a fine summer. We've the very first hint of summer
we've had, and it's cheerful to see the sky and to feel
the sunshine.</p></div>

American Embassy,<br />

London, May 3, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR EFFENDI:</p>

<p>I aim this at you. It may hit a German submarine.
But we've got to take our chances in these days of risk.
Your letter from the tropics&mdash;a letter from you from any
place is as scarce as peace!&mdash;gave me a pleasant thrill and
reminder of a previous state of existence, a long way back
in the past. I wonder if, on your side the ocean you are
living at the rate of a century a year, as we are here?
Here in bountiful England we are living on rations. I
spent a night with the King a fortnight ago, and he gave
us only so much bread, one egg apiece, and&mdash;lemonade.
We are to begin bread tickets next week. All this is perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-241" id="page2-241"></a>[pg II-241]</span>
healthful and wholesome and as much as I ever eat.
But the hard part of it is that it's necessary. We haven't
more than six weeks' food supply and the submarines
sunk eighty-eight ships&mdash;237,000 tons&mdash;last week. These
English do not publish these harrowing facts, and nobody
knows them but a few official people. And they are destroying
the submarines at a most beggarly slow rate.
They work far out at sea&mdash;100 to 200 miles&mdash;and it's as
hard to find them as it would be to find whales. The simple
truth is we are in a dangerous plight. If they could
stop this submarine warfare, the war would pretty quickly
be won, for the Germans are in a far worse plight for food
and materials and they are getting much the worst of it
on land. The war would be won this summer or autumn
if the submarine could be put out of business. If it isn't,
the Germans may use this success to keep their spirits up
and go on till next year.</p>

<p>We (the United States) have about 40 destroyers. We
are sending over 6! I'm doing my best to persuade the
Government at Washington to send every one we have.
But, since the British conceal the facts from their own
press and the people and from all the world, the full pressure
of the situation is hard to exert on Washington. Our
Admiral (Sims) and I are trying our best, and we are
spending enough on cables to build a destroyer. All this,
you must, of course, regard as a dark secret; but it's a
devilish black secret.</p>

<p>I don't mean that there's any danger of losing the war.
Even if the British armies have to have their food cut
down and people here go hungry, they'll win; but the
winning may be a long time off. Nothing but their continued
success can keep the Germans going. Their people
are war-weary and hungry. Austria is knocked out
and is starving. Turkey is done up but can go on living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-242" id="page2-242"></a>[pg II-242]</span>
on nothing, but not fighting much more. When peace
comes, there'll be a general famine, on the continent at
least, and no ships to haul food. This side of the world
will have to start life all over again&mdash;with insufficient
men to carry things on and innumerable maimed men
who'll have (more or less) to be cared for. The horror of
the whole thing nobody realizes. We've all got used to
it here; and nobody clearly remembers just what the world
was like in peace times; those times were so far away. All
this I write not to fill you with horrors but to prove that
I speak the literal truth when I say that it seems a hundred
years since I had before heard from you.</p>

<p>Just how all this affects a man, no man can accurately
tell. Of how much use I'll be when I can get home, I
don't know. Sometimes I think that I shall be of vastly
greater use than ever. Plans and publishing ambitions
pop up in my mind at times which look good and promising.
I see books and series of books. I see most useful
magazine stuff. Then, before I can think anything out
to a clear plan or conclusion, the ever-increasing official
duties and responsibilities here knock everything else out
of my head, perhaps for a whole month. It's a literal
fact that many a month I do not have an hour to do with
as I please nor to think about what I please, from the time
I wake up till I go to bed. In spite of twenty-four secretaries
(the best fellows that ever were and the best staff
that any Embassy ever had in the world) more and more
work comes to me. I thank Heaven we no longer have
the interests of Germany, Austria, and Turkey to look
after; but with our coming into the war, work in general
has increased enormously. I have to spend very much
more time with the different departments of the British
Government on war plans and such like things. They
have welcomed us in very handsomely; and one form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-243" id="page2-243"></a>[pg II-243]</span>
their welcome is consulting with me about&mdash;navy plans,
war plans, loans of billions, ships, censorship, secret
service&mdash;everything you ever heard of. At first it seemed a
little comical for the admirals and generals and the Governor
of the Bank of England to come and ask for advice.
But when I gave it and it worked out well, I went on
and, after all, the thing's easier than it looks. With a
little practice you can give these fellows several points in
the game and play a pretty good hand. They don't know
half as much as you might suppose they'd know. All
these years of lecturing the State Department and the
President got my hand in! The whole game is far easier
than any small business. You always play with blue
chips better than you play with white ones.</p>

<p>This country and these people are not the country and
the people they were three years ago. They are very
different. They are much more democratic, far less
cocksure, far less haughty, far humbler. The man at the
head of the army rose from the ranks. The Prime Minister
is a poor Welsh schoolteacher's son, without early
education. The man who controls all British shipping
began life as a shipping &quot;clark,&quot; at ten shillings a week.
Yet the Lords and Ladies, too, have shown that they were
made of the real stuff. This experience is making England
over again. There never was a more interesting thing to
watch and to be part of.</p>

<p>There are about twenty American organizations here&mdash;big,
little, rag-tag, and bobtail. When we declared war,
every one of 'em proceeded to prepare for some sort of
celebration. There would have been an epidemic of
Fourth-of-July oratory all over the town&mdash;before we'd
done anything&mdash;Americans spouting over the edges and
killing Kruger with their mouths. I got representatives
of 'em all together and proposed that we hold our tongues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-244" id="page2-244"></a>[pg II-244]</span>
till we'd won the war&mdash;then we can take London. And
to give one occasion when we might all assemble and dedicate
ourselves to this present grim business, I arranged for
an American Dedicatory Service at St. Paul's Cathedral.
The royal family came, the Government came, the Allied
diplomats came, my Lords and Ladies came, one hundred
wounded American (Canadian) soldiers came&mdash;the pick
of the Kingdom; my Navy and Army staff went in full
uniform, the Stars and Stripes hung before the altar, a
double brass band played the Star Spangled Banner and
the Battle Hymn of the Republic, and an American bishop
(Brent) preached a red-hot American sermon, the Archbishop
of Canterbury delivered the benediction; and (for
the first time in English history) a foreign flag (the Stars
and Stripes) flew over the Houses of Parliament. It was
the biggest occasion, so they say, that St. Paul's ever had.
And there's been no spilling of American oratory since!
If you had published a shilling edition of the words and
music of the Star Spangled Banner and the Battle Hymn
you could have sent a cargo of 'em here and sold them.
There isn't paper enough in this Kingdom to get out an
edition here.</p>

<p>Give my love to all the Doubledays and to all the fellows
in the shop, and (I wonder if you will) try your hand at
another letter. You write very legibly these days!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Sincerely yours,<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>&quot;Curiously enough,&quot; Page wrote about this time, &quot;these
most exciting days of the war are among the most barren
of exciting topics for private correspondence. The 'atmosphere'
here is unchanging&mdash;to us&mdash;and the British are
turning their best side to us continuously. They are
increasingly appreciative, and they see more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-245" id="page2-245"></a>[pg II-245]</span>
clearly that our coming into the war is all that saved them
from a virtual defeat&mdash;I mean the public sees this more
and more clearly, for, of course, the Government has
known it from the beginning. I even find a sort of morbid
fear lest they do not sufficiently show their appreciation.
The Archbishop last night asked me in an apprehensive
tone whether the American Government and
public felt that the British did not sufficiently show their
gratitude. I told him that we did not come into the war
to win compliments but to whip the enemy, and that we
wanted all the help the British can give: that's the main
thing; and that thereafter of course we liked appreciation,
but that expressions of appreciation had not been lacking.
Mr. Balfour and Sir Edward Carson also spoke to me
yesterday much in the same tone as the Archbishop of
Canterbury.</p>

<p>&quot;Try to think out any line of action that one will, or
any future sequence of events or any plan touching the
war, one runs into the question whether the British are
doing the best that could be done or are merely plugging
away. They are, as a people, slow and unimaginative,
given to over-much self-criticism; but they eternally hold
on to a task or to a policy. Yet the question forever
arises whether they show imagination, to say nothing of
genius, and whether the waste of a slow, plodding policy
is the necessary price of victory.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course such a question is easy to ask and it is easy
to give dogmatic answers. But it isn't easy to give an
answer based on facts. Our General Lassiter<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57" /><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, for
instance&mdash;a man of sound judgment&mdash;has in general been
less hopeful of the military situation in France than most
of the British officers. But he is just now returned from
the front, much cheered and encouraged. 'Lassiter,' I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-246" id="page2-246"></a>[pg II-246]</span>
asked, 'have the British in France or has any man among
them what we call genius, or even wide vision; or are they
merely plodding along at a mechanical task? His
answer was, 'We don't see genius till it has done its job.
It is a mechanical task&mdash;yes, that's the nature of the struggle&mdash;and
they surely do it with intelligence and spirit.
There is waste. There is waste in all wars. But I come
back much more encouraged.'</p>

<p>&quot;The same sort of questions and answers are asked and
given continuously about naval action. Every discussion
of the possibility of attacking the German naval bases
ends without a plan. So also with preventing the submarines
from coming out. These subjects have been
continuously under discussion by a long series of men who
have studied them; and the total effect so far has been to
leave them among the impossible tasks. So far as I can
ascertain all naval men among the Allies agree that these
things can't be done.</p>

<p>&quot;Here again&mdash;Is this a merely routine professional
opinion&mdash;a merely traditional opinion&mdash;or is it a lack of
imagination? The question will not down. Yet it is
impossible to get facts to combat it. What are the limits
of the practicable?</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Balfour told me yesterday his personal conviction
about the German colonies, which, he said, he had
not discussed with his associates in the Cabinet. His
firm opinion is that they ought not to be returned to the
Germans, first for the sake of humanity. 'The natives&mdash;the
Africans especially&mdash;have been so barbarously
treated and so immorally that it would be inhuman
to permit the Germans to rule and degrade them further.
But Heaven forbid that we should still further enlarge the
British Empire. As a practical matter I do not care to do
that. Besides, we should incur the criticism of fighting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-247" id="page2-247"></a>[pg II-247]</span>
in order to get more territory, and that was not and is not
our aim. If the United States will help us, my wish is
that these German Colonies that we have taken, especially
in Africa, should be &quot;internationalized.&quot; There are
great difficulties in such a plan, but they are not insuperable
if the great Powers of the Allies will agree upon it.'
And much more to the same effect. The parts of Asiatic
Turkey that the British have taken, he thought, might be
treated in the same way.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII" />CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE BALFOUR MISSION TO THE UNITED STATES</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Page now took up a subject which had been near his
heart for a long time. He believed that one of the
most serious causes of Anglo-American misunderstanding
was the fact that the leading statesmen of the two countries
had never had any personal contact with one another.
At one time, as this correspondence shows, the Ambassador
had even hoped that President Wilson himself might
cross the ocean and make the British people an official
visit. The proposal, however, was made before the
European war broke out, the occasion which Page had
in mind being the dedication of Sulgrave Manor, the old
English home of the Washington family, as a perpetual
memorial to the racial bonds and common ideals uniting
the two countries. The President found it impossible
to act upon this suggestion and the outbreak of war made
the likelihood of such a visit still more remote. Page had
made one unsuccessful attempt to bring the American
State Department and the British Foreign Office into
personal contact. At the moment when American irritation
had been most keen over the blockade and the
blacklist, Page had persuaded the Foreign Office to invite
to England Mr. Frank L. Polk, at that time Counsellor of
the Department; the Ambassador believed that a few
conversations between such an intelligent gentleman
as Mr. Polk and the British statesmen would smooth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-249" id="page2-249"></a>[pg II-249]</span>
out all the points which were then making things so
difficult. Unfortunately the pressure of work at Washington
prevented Mr. Polk from accepting Sir Edward
Grey's invitation.</p>

<p>But now a greater necessity for close personal association
had arisen. The United States had entered the war, and
this declaration had practically made this country an ally
of Great Britain and France. The British Government
wished to send a distinguished commission to the United
States, for two reasons: first, to show its appreciation of
the stand which America had taken, and secondly, to discuss
plans for co&ouml;peration in the common task. Great
Britain frankly admitted that it had made many mistakes
in the preceding three years&mdash;mistakes naval, military,
political, and economic; it would welcome an opportunity
to display these errors to Washington, which might naturally
hope to profit from them. As soon as his country was
in the war, Page took up this suggestion with the Foreign
Office. There was of course one man who was pre&euml;minently
fitted, by experience, position, and personal qualities,
to head such a commission; on this point there was
no discussion. Mr. Balfour was now in his seventieth
year; his activities in British politics dated back to the
times of Disraeli; his position in Great Britain had become
as near that of an &quot;elder statesman&quot; as is tolerable under
the Anglo-Saxon system. By this time Page had established
the friendliest possible relations with this distinguished
man. Mr. Balfour had become Foreign Secretary
in December, 1916, in succession to Lord Grey. Greatly
as Page regretted the resignation of Grey, he was much
gratified that Mr. Balfour had been selected to succeed
him. Mr. Balfour's record for twenty-five years had been
one of consistent friendliness toward the United States.
When President Cleveland's Venezuelan message, in 1896,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-250" id="page2-250"></a>[pg II-250]</span>
had precipitated a crisis in the relations of the two countries,
it was Mr. Balfour's influence which was especially
potent in causing Great Britain to modify its attitude and
to accept the American demand for arbitration. That
action not only amicably settled the Venezuelan question;
it marked the beginning of a better feeling between the
English-speaking countries and laid the basis for that
policy of benevolent neutrality which Great Britain had
maintained toward the United States in the Spanish War.
The excellent spirit which Mr. Balfour had shown at this
crisis he had manifested on many occasions since. In the
criticisms of the United States during the <i>Lusitania</i>
troubles Mr. Balfour had never taken part. The era of
&quot;neutrality&quot; had not ruffled the confidence which he had
always felt in the United States. During all this time the
most conspicuous dinner tables of London had rung with
criticisms of American policy; the fact was well known,
however, that Mr. Balfour had never sympathized with these
reproaches; even when he was not in office, no unfriendly
word concerning the United States had ever escaped his
lips. His feeling toward this country was well shown in
a letter which he wrote Page, in reply to one congratulating
him on his seventieth birthday. &quot;I have now lived
a long life,&quot; said Mr. Balfour, &quot;and most of my energies
have been expended in political work, but if I have been
fortunate enough to contribute, even in the smallest degree,
to drawing closer the bonds that unite our two countries,
I shall have done something compared with which
all else that I may have attempted counts in my eyes as
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Page's letters and notes contain many references to Mr.
Balfour's kindly spirit. On the day following the dismissal
of Bernstorff the American Ambassador lunched
with the Foreign Secretary at No. 4 Carlton Gardens.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-251" id="page2-251"></a>[pg II-251]</span></div>
<p>&quot;Mr. Balfour,&quot; Page reported to Washington, &quot;gave
expression to the hearty admiration which he entertained
for the President's handling of a difficult task. He said
that never for a moment had he doubted the President's
wisdom in the course he was pursuing. He had the
profoundest admiration for the manner in which he had
promptly broken with Germany after receiving Germany's
latest note. Nor had he ever entertained the slightest
question of the American people's ready loyalty to their
Government or to their high ideals. One of his intellectual
pleasures, he added, had long been contemplation of
the United States as it is and, even more, as its influence in
the world will broaden. 'The world,' said Mr. Balfour,
'will more and more turn on the Great Republic as on a
pivot.'&quot;</p>

<p>Occasionally Mr. Balfour's discussion of the United
States would take a more pensive turn. A memorandum
which Page wrote a few weeks after the above touches
another point:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>March 27, 1917.</p>

<p>I had a most interesting conversation with Mr.
Balfour this afternoon. &quot;It's sad to me,&quot; said he, &quot;that
we are so unpopular, so much more unpopular than the
French, in your country. Why is it? The old school
books?&quot;</p>

<p>I doubted the school-book influence.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly their influence is not the main cause. It is
the organized Irish. Then it's the effect of the very fact
that the Irish question is not settled. You've had that
problem at your very door for 300 years. What's the
matter that you don't solve it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot;&mdash;he saw it. But the plaintive tone of
such a man asking such a question was significant and
interesting and&mdash;sad.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-252" id="page2-252"></a>[pg II-252]</span>
<p>Then I told him the curious fact that a British Government
made up of twenty individuals, every one of whom
is most friendly to the United States, will, when they
act together as a Government, do the most offensive
things. I mentioned the blacklist; I mentioned certain
complaints that I then held in my hand&mdash;of Americans
here who are told by the British Government that they
must turn over to the British Government's agent in New
York their American securities which they hold in America!</p>

<p>There's a sort of imperious, arrogant, Tory action that
comes natural to the English Government, even when not
natural to the individual Englishman.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On April 5th, the day before the United States formally
declared war, Page notified Washington that the British
Government wished Mr. Balfour to go to the United
States as the head of a Commission to confer with our
Government. &quot;Mr. Balfour is chosen for this mission,&quot;
Page reported, &quot;not only because he is Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, but because he is personally the most
distinguished member of the Government.&quot; Page tells the
story in more detail in a letter to Mr. Polk, at that time
Counsellor of the State Department.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Frank L. Polk</i><br />
<br />
London, May 3, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. POLK:</p>

<p>... Mr. Balfour accurately represents British
character, British opinion, and the British attitude. Nobody
who knows him and knows British character and the
British attitude ever doubted that. I know his whole
tribe, his home-life, his family connections, his friends; and,
of course, since he became Foreign Secretary, I've come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-253" id="page2-253"></a>[pg II-253]</span>
to know him intimately. When the question first came
up here of his going, of course I welcomed it enthusiastically.
About that time during a two-hour conversation
he asked me why the British were so unpopular in the
United States. Among other reasons I told him that our
official people on both sides steadfastly refused to visit
one another and to become acquainted. Neither he nor
Lord Grey, nor Mr. Asquith, nor Mr. Lloyd George, had
ever been to the United States, nor any other important
British statesman in recent times, and not a single
member of the Administration was personally known to a
single member of the British Government. &quot;I'll go,&quot;
said he, &quot;if you are perfectly sure my going will be agreeable
to the President.&quot; He himself recalled the fact,
during one of our several conversations just before he left,
that you had not come when he and Lord Grey had invited
you. If you had come, by the way, this era of a better
understanding would have begun then, and half our old
troubles would then have been removed. Keeping away
from one another is the best of all methods of keeping all
old misunderstandings alive and of making new ones.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Mr. Balfour's visit will cause visits
of many first-class British statesmen during the war or
soon afterward. That's all we need to bring about a perfect
understanding.</p>

<p>You may remember how I tried to get an official report
about the behaviour of the <i>Benham</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58" /><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, and how, in the
absence of that, Lord Beresford made a disagreeable speech
about our Navy in the House of Lords, and how, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-254" id="page2-254"></a>[pg II-254]</span>
months later you sent me Roosevelt's<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59" /><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> letter, Lord Beresford
expressed regret to me and said that he would explain
in another speech. I hadn't seen the old fellow for a long
time till a fortnight ago. He greeted me cheerily, and I
said, &quot;I don't think I ought to shake hands with you till
you retract what you said about our navy.&quot; He insisted
on my dining with him. He invited Admiral Sims also,
and those two sailors had a jolly evening of it. Sims's
coming has straightened out all that naval misunderstanding
and more. He is of immense help to them and
to us. But I'm going to make old Beresford's life a burden
till he gets up in the Lords and takes that speech back&mdash;publicly.
He's really all right; but it's just as well to
keep the records right. The proceedings of the House of
Lords are handsomely bound and go into every gentleman's
library. I have seen two centuries of them in
many a house.</p>

<p>We can now begin a distinctly New Era in the world's
history and in its management if we rise to the occasion:
there's not a shadow of doubt about that. And the
United States can play a part bigger than we have yet
dreamed of if we prove big enough to lead the British and
the French instead of listening to Irish and Germans.
Neither England nor France is a democracy&mdash;far from it.
We can make them both democracies and develop their
whole people instead of about 10 per cent. of their
people. We have simply to conduct our affairs by a large
national policy and not by the complaints of our really
non-American people. See how a declaration of war has
cleared the atmosphere!</p>

<p>We're happy yet, on rations. There are no potatoes.
We have meatless days. Good wheat meantime is sunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-255" id="page2-255"></a>[pg II-255]</span>
every day. The submarine must be knocked out. Else
the earth will be ruled by the German bayonet and natural
living will be <i>verboten</i>. We'll all have to goose-step as the
Crown Prince orders or&mdash;be shot. I see they now propose
that the United States shall pay the big war indemnity
in raw materials to the value of hundreds of billions of
dollars! Not just yet, I guess!</p>

<p>As we get reports of what you are doing, it's most cheerful.
I assure you, God has yet made nothing or nobody
equal to the American people; and I don't think He ever
will or can.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Sincerely yours,<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>One of the curious developments of this Balfour Mission
was a request from President Wilson that Great Britain
should take some decisive step for the permanent settlement
of the Irish question. &quot;The President,&quot; this message
ran, &quot;wishes that, when you next meet the Prime
Minister, you would explain to him that only one circumstance
now appears to stand in the way of perfect
co&ouml;peration with Great Britain. All Americans who
are not immediately connected with Germany by blood
ties find their one difficulty in the failure of Great Britain
so far to establish a satisfactory form of self-government in
Ireland. In the recent debates in Congress on the War
Resolution, this sentiment was especially manifest. It
came out in the speeches of those enemies of the Declaration
who were not Irish themselves nor representatives of
sections in which Irish voters possessed great influence&mdash;notably
members from the Southern States.</p>

<p>&quot;If the American people were once convinced that there
was a likelihood that the Irish question would soon be
settled, great enthusiasm and satisfaction would result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-256" id="page2-256"></a>[pg II-256]</span>
and it would also strengthen the co&ouml;peration which we are
now about to organize between the United States and
Great Britain. Say this in unofficial terms to Mr. Lloyd
George, but impress upon him its very great significance.
If the British Government should act successfully on this
matter, our American citizens of Irish descent and to a
great extent the German sympathizers who have made
common cause with the Irish, would join hands in the
great common cause.&quot;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
London, May 4, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>... It is a remarkable commentary on the insularity
of the British and on our studied isolation that till Mr.
Balfour went over not a member of this Government had
ever met a member of our Administration! Quite half
our misunderstandings were due to this. If I had the
making of the laws of the two governments, I'd have a
statutory requirement that at least one visit a year by
high official persons should be made either way. We
should never have had a blacklist, etc., if that had been
done. When I tried the quite humble task of getting
Polk to come and the excuse was made that he couldn't
be spared from his desk&mdash;Mr. President, I fear we haven't
half enough responsible official persons in our Government.
I should say that no man even of Polk's rank
ought to have a desk: just as well give him a mill-stone.
Even I try not to have a desk: else I'd never get anything
of importance done; for I find that talks and conferences
in my office and in the government offices and wherever
else I can find out things take all my waking hours. The
Foreign Office here has about five high position men to
every one in the State Department. God sparing me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-257" id="page2-257"></a>[pg II-257]</span>
I'm going one of these days to prepare a paper for our
Foreign Affairs Committee on the Waste of Having
too Few High Grade Men in the Department of State;
a Plea for Five Assistant Secretaries for Every One Now
Existing and for Provision for International Visits by
Them.</p>

<p>Here's an ancient and mouldy precedent that needs
shattering&mdash;for the coming of our country into its proper
station and influence in the world.</p>

<p>I am sure that Mr. Balfour's visit has turned out as well
as I hoped, and my hopes were high. He is one of the
most interesting men that I've ever had the honour
to know intimately&mdash;he and Lord Grey. Mr. Balfour
is a Tory, of course; and in general I don't like Tories,
yet liberal he surely is&mdash;a sort of high-toned Scotch democrat.
I have studied him with increasing charm and
interest. Not infrequently when I am in his office just
before luncheon he says, &quot;Come, walk over and we'll
have lunch with the family.&quot; He's a bachelor. One
sister lives with him. Another (Lady Rayleigh, the
wife of the great chemist and Chancellor of Cambridge
University) frequently visits him. Either of those
ladies could rule this Empire. Then there are nieces and
cousins always about&mdash;people of rare cultivation, every
one of 'em. One of those girls confirmed the story that
&quot;Uncle Arthur&quot; one day concluded that the niblick was
something more than a humble necessity of a bad golfer&mdash;that
it had positive virtues of its own and had suffered
centuries of neglect. He, therefore, proceeded to play
with the niblick only, till he proved his case and showed
that it is a club entitled to the highest respect.</p>

<p>A fierce old Liberal fighter in Parliamentary warfare,
who entered politics about the time Mr. Balfour did,
told me this story the other day. &quot;I've watched Balfour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-258" id="page2-258"></a>[pg II-258]</span>
for about forty years as a cat watches a rat. I hate his
party. I hated him till I learned better, for I hated that
whole Salisbury crowd. They wanted to Cecil everything.
But I'll tell you, Sir, apropos of his visit to your
country, that in all those years he has never spoken of the
United States except with high respect and often with deep
affection. I should have caught him, if he had.&quot;</p>

<p>I went with him to a college in London one afternoon
where he delivered a lecture on Dryden, to prove that
poetry can carry a certain cargo of argument but that
argument can't raise the smallest flight of poetry. Dry
as it sounds, it was as good a literary performance as I
recall I ever heard.</p>

<p>At his &quot;family&quot; luncheon, I've found Lord Milner or
Lord Lansdowne, or some literary man who had come in
to find out from Lady Rayleigh how to conduct the
Empire or to write a great book; and the modest old
chemical Lord sits silent most of the time and now and
then breaks loose to confound them all with a pat joke.
This is a vigorous family, these Balfours. There's one
of them (a cousin of some sort, I think, of the Foreign
Secretary) who is a Lord of much of Scotland, about as
tall as Ben Nevis is high&mdash;a giant of a man. One of his
sons was killed early in the war and one was missing&mdash;whether
dead or not he did not know. Mrs. Page expressed
her hope one day to the old man that he had had
news from his missing son. &quot;No, no,&quot; said he simply,
&quot;and me lady is awearying.&quot;</p>

<p>We've been lucky, Mr. President, in these days of
immortal horrors and of difficulties between two governments
that did not know one another&mdash;uncommonly lucky,
in the large chances that politics gives for grave errors,
to have had two such men in the Foreign Office here as
Lord Grey and Mr. Balfour. There are men who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-259" id="page2-259"></a>[pg II-259]</span>
mentioned for this post that would have driven us mad&mdash;or
to war with them. I'm afraid I've almost outgrown
my living hero worship. There isn't worshipful material
enough lying around in the world to keep a vigorous reverence
in practice. But these two gentlemen by birth
and culture have at least sometimes seemed of heroic size
to me. It has meant much to know them well. I shall
always be grateful to them, for in their quiet, forceful
way they helped me much to establish right relations
with these people&mdash;which, pray God, I hope to retain
through whatever new trials we may yet encounter. For
it will fall to us yet to loose and to free the British, and a
Briton set free is an American. That's all you can do for
a man or for a nation of men.</p>

<p>These Foreign Secretaries are not only men of much
greater cultivation than their Prime Ministers but of
greater moral force. But I've come to like Lloyd George
very much. He'd never deliver a lecture on Dryden, and
he doesn't even play a good game of golf; but he has what
both Lord Grey and Mr. Balfour lack&mdash;a touch of genius&mdash;whatever
that is&mdash;not the kind that takes infinite pains,
but the kind that acts as an electric light flashed in the
dark. He said to me the other day that experts have
nearly been the death of him. &quot;The Government has
experts, experts, experts, everywhere. In any department
where things are not going well, I have found boards
and committees and boards of experts. But in one department
at least I've found a substitute for them. I let
twenty experts go and I put in one Man, and things
began to move at once. Do you know any real Men?
When you hear of any, won't you let me know?&quot;</p>

<p>A little while ago he dined with me, and, after dinner, I
took him to a corner of the drawing room and delivered
your message to him about Ireland. &quot;God knows, I'm trying,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-260" id="page2-260"></a>[pg II-260]</span>
he replied. &quot;Tell the President that. And tell him
to talk to Balfour.&quot; Presently he broke out&mdash;&quot;Madmen,
madmen&mdash;I never saw any such task,&quot; and he pointed
across the room to Sir Edward Carson, his First Lord of
the Admiralty&mdash;&quot;Madmen.&quot; &quot;But the President's right.
We've got to settle it and we've got to settle it now.&quot; Carson
and Jellicoe came across the room and sat down with
us. &quot;I've been telling the Ambassador, Carson, that
we've got to settle the Irish question now&mdash;in spite of
you.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you something else we've got to settle now,&quot;
said Carson. &quot;Else it'll settle us. That's the submarines.
The press and public are working up a calculated and
concerted attack on Jellicoe and me, and, if they get us,
they'll get you. It's an attack on the Government made
on the Admiralty. Prime Minister,&quot; said this Ulster
pirate whose civil war didn't come off only because the
big war was begun&mdash;&quot;Prime Minister, it may be a fierce
attack. Get ready for it.&quot; Well, it has been developing
ever since. But I can't for the life of me guess at the
possible results of an English Parliamentary attack on a
government. It's like a baseball man watching a game
of cricket. He can't see when the player is out or why, or
what caused it. Of course, the submarine may torpedo
Lloyd George and his Government. It looks very like
it may overturn the Admiralty, as Gallipoli did. If this
public finds out the whole truth, it will demand somebody's
head. But I'm only a baseball man; cricket is
beyond me.</p>

<p>But Lloyd George will outlive the war as an active force,
whatever happen to him in the meantime. He's too heavily
charged with electricity to stop activity. The war
has ended a good many careers that seemed to have long
promise. It is ending more every day. But there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-261" id="page2-261"></a>[pg II-261]</span>
only one Lloyd George, and, whatever else he lack, he
doesn't lack life.</p>

<p>I heard all the speeches in both Houses on the resolution
of appreciation of our coming into the war&mdash;Bonar Law's,
Asquith's (one of the best), Dillon's, a Labour man's,
and, in the Lords, Curzon's, Crewe's, the Archbishop's
(who delivered in the course of his remarks a benediction
on me) and Bryce's (almost the best of all). It wasn't
&quot;oratory,&quot; but it was well said and well meant. They
know how badly they need help and they do mean to be as
good to us as their benignant insularity will permit. They
are changing. I can't describe the great difference that
the war has made in them. They'll almost become docile
in a little more time.</p>

<p>And we came in in the nick of time for them&mdash;in very
truth. If we hadn't, their exchange would have gone
down soon and they know it. I shall never forget the
afternoon I spent with Mr. Balfour and Mr. Bonar Law
on that subject. They saw blue ruin without our financial
help. And now, if we can save them from submarines,
those that know will know how vital our help was.
Again, the submarine is the great and grave and perhaps
the only danger now. If that can be scotched, I believe
the whole Teutonic military structure would soon tumble.
If not, the Germans may go on as long as they can
feed their army, allowing their people to starve.</p>

<p>Of course, you know, we're on rations now&mdash;yet we
suffer no inconvenience on that score. But these queer
people (they are the most amusing and confusing and
contradictory of all God's creatures, these English, whose
possibilities are infinite and whose actualities, in many
ways, are pitiful)&mdash;these queer people are fiercely pursuing
food-economy by discussing in the newspapers
whether a hen consumes more food than she produces, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-262" id="page2-262"></a>[pg II-262]</span>
whether what dogs eat contains enough human food to
justify the shooting of every one in the Kingdom. That's
the way we are coming down to humble fare. But nothing
can quite starve a people who all live near the sea
which yields fish enough near shore to feed them wastefully.</p>

<p>All along this South shore, where I am to-day<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60" /><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, I see the
Stars and Stripes; and everywhere there is a demand for
the words and music of the Battle Hymn of the Republic
and the Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p>This our-new-Ally business is bringing me a lot of
amusing troubles. Theatres offer me boxes, universities
offer me degrees, hospitals solicit visits from me, clubs
offer me dinners&mdash;I'll have to get a new private secretary
or two well-trained to say &quot;No&quot; politely, else I shall not
have my work done. But all that will presently wear
away as everything wears away (quickly, too) in the grim
face of this bloody monster of war which is consuming
men as a prairie fire consumes blades of grass. There's
a family that lives around the corner from this hotel.
One son is in the trenches, another is in a madhouse from
shell-shock, a third coming home wounded the other day
was barely rescued when a torpedo sunk a hospital ship
and may lose his reason. I suppose I saw one hundred
men this afternoon on a single mile of beach who had lost
both legs. Through the wall from my house in London
is a hospital. A young Texan has been there, whose
legs are gone at the thighs and one arm at the elbow.
God pity us for not having organized the world better
than this! We'll do it, yet, Mr. President&mdash;<i>you'll</i> do it;
and thank God for you. If we do not organize Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-263" id="page2-263"></a>[pg II-263]</span>
and make another such catastrophe impossible, life will
not be worth being born into except to the few whose
days happen to fall between recurring devastations of the
world.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours sincerely,<br />

WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>&quot;I hope that the English people,&quot; Colonel House wrote
to Page about this time, &quot;realize how successful Mr.
Balfour's visit to America really was. There is no man
they could have sent who could have done it better. He
and the President got along marvellously well. The
three of us dined and spent the evening together and it
was delightful to see how sympathetic their minds were.&quot;</p>

<p>A letter from Mr. Polk also discloses the impression
which Mr. Balfour made upon Washington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>From Frank L. Polk</i><br />
<br />
Washington, May 25, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR MR. PAGE:</p>

<p>I just want to get off a line to catch the pouch.</p>

<p>You probably know what a wonderful success the British
Mission has been, but I do not think you can realize
what a deep impression they have made on all of us. Mr.
Balfour really won the affection of us all, and I do not
know when I was more sorry to have a man leave than I
was to have him go last night. He expressed himself
as having been very much impressed with his reception
and the way he was treated. He was most fair in all discussions,
and I think has a better understanding of our
point of view. I had the good fortune of being present
at the financial and the diplomatic conferences, and I
think we all felt that we were dealing with a sympathetic
friend.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-264" id="page2-264"></a>[pg II-264]</span>
<p>He and the President got on tremendously. The best
evidence of that was the fact that the President went
up to Congress and sat in the gallery while Mr. Balfour
addressed the House. This is without precedent.</p>

<p>The difficult problem of course was the blacklist and
bunkering agreement, but I think we are by that. The
important thing now is for the British to make all the concessions
possible in connection with the release of goods
in Rotterdam and the release of goods in Prize Court,
though the cases have not been begun. Of course I
mean cases of merely suspicion rather than where there is
evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The sending of the destroyers and troops abroad is going
to do a great deal toward impressing our people with the
fact that we really are in the war. I do not think it is
thoroughly borne home on the majority yet what a serious
road we have chosen.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
With warm regards,<br />
<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
<br />
FRANK L. POLK.<br />
</div>

<p>Mr. Polk's reference to the blacklist recalls an episode
which in itself illustrates the changed character of the relations
that had now been established between the American
and the British governments. Mr. Balfour discussed
shipping problems for the most part with Mr. Polk, under
whose jurisdiction these matters fell. As one of these
conferences was approaching its end Mr. Balfour slightly
coughed, uttered an &quot;er,&quot; and gave other indications that
he was about to touch upon a ticklish question.</p>

<p>&quot;Before I go,&quot; he said, &quot;there&mdash;er&mdash;is one subject I
would&mdash;er&mdash;like to say something about.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Polk at once grasped what was coming.</p>

<p>&quot;I know what you have in mind,&quot; said Mr. Polk in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-265" id="page2-265"></a>[pg II-265]</span>
characteristically quick way. &quot;You want us to apply your
blacklist to neutrals.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, the British hoped that the United States,
now that it was in the war, would adopt against South
America and other offenders those same discriminations
which this country had so fiercely objected to, when it was
itself a neutral.</p>

<p>The British statesman gave Mr. Polk one of his most
winning smiles and nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Balfour,&quot; said Mr. Polk, &quot;it took Great Britain
three years to reach a point where it was prepared to violate
all the laws of blockade. You will find that it will
take us only two months to become as great criminals as
you are!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour is usually not explosive in his manifestations
of mirth, but his laughter, in reply to this statement,
was almost uproarious. And the State Department was
as good as its word. It immediately forgot all the elaborate
&quot;notes&quot; and &quot;protests&quot; which it had been addressing
to Great Britain. It became more inexorable than
Great Britain had ever been in keeping foodstuffs out of
neutral countries that were contiguous to Germany. Up
to the time the United States entered the war, Germany,
in spite of the watchful British fleet, had been obtaining
large supplies from the United States through Holland,
Denmark, and the Scandinavian peninsula. But the
United States now immediately closed these leaks. In the
main this country adopted a policy of &quot;rationing&quot;; that
is, it would furnish the little nations adjoining Germany
precisely the amount of food which they needed for their
own consumption. This policy was one of the chief influences
in undermining the German people and forcing
their surrender. The American Government extended
likewise the blacklist to South America and other countries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-266" id="page2-266"></a>[pg II-266]</span>
and, in doing so, it bettered the instruction of Great
Britain herself.</p>

<p>Though the whole story of the blockade thus seems finally
to have ended in a joke, the whole proceeding has its
serious side. The United States had been posing for three
years as the champion of neutral rights; the point of view
of Washington had been that there was a great principle
at stake. If such a principle were involved, it was certainly
present in just the same degree after the United
States became belligerent as in the days when we were
neutrals. The lofty ideals by which the Administration
had professed to be guided should have still controlled its
actions; the mere fact that we, as a belligerent, could obtain
certain advantages would hardly have justified a
great and high-minded nation in abandoning its principles.
Yet abandon them we did from the day that we declared
war. We became just as remorseless in disregarding the
rights of small states as Great Britain&mdash;according to our
numerous blockade notes&mdash;had been. Possibly, therefore,
Mr. Balfour's mirth was not merely sympathetic or
humorous; it perhaps echoed his discovery that our position
for three years had really been nothing but a sham;
that the State Department had been forcing points in
which it did not really believe, or in which it did not believe
when American interests were involved. At any rate,
this ending of our long argument with Great Britain was
a splendid justification for Page; his contention had always
been that the preservation of civilization was more
important than the technicalities of the international
lawyers. And now the Wilson Administration, by throwing
into the waste basket all the finespun theories with
which it had been embarrassing the Allied cause since
August 4, 1914, accepted&mdash;and accepted joyously&mdash;his
point of view.</p>


<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-267" id="page2-267"></a>[pg II-267]</span></div>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>One of the first things which Mr. Balfour did, on his
arrival in Washington, was personally to explain to
President Wilson about the so-called &quot;secret treaties.&quot;
The &quot;secret treaty&quot; that especially preyed upon Mr.
Wilson's mind, and which led to a famous episode at the
Versailles Conference, was that which had been made with
Italy in 1915, as consideration for Italy's participation in
the war. Mr. Balfour, in telling the President of these
territorial arrangements with Italy, naturally did not
criticise his ally, but it was evident that he regarded the
matter as something about which the United States should
be informed.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the sort of thing you have to do when you are
engaged in a war,&quot; he explained, and then he gave Mr.
Wilson the details.</p>

<p>Probably the most important information which Mr.
Balfour and the French and Italian Commissions brought
to Washington was the desperate situation of the Allied
cause. On that point not one of the visiting statesmen
or military and naval advisers made the slightest attempt
at concealment. Mr. Balfour emphasized the seriousness
of the crisis in one of his earliest talks with Mr. McAdoo,
Secretary of the Treasury. The British statesman was
especially interested in the financial situation and he therefore
took up this matter at an early date with the Treasury
Department.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Balfour,&quot; said Mr. McAdoo, &quot;before we make any
plans of financial assistance it is absolutely necessary that
we know precisely where we stand. The all-important
thing is the question as to how long the war is likely to
last. If it is only to last a few months, it is evident that
we need to make very different arrangements than if it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-268" id="page2-268"></a>[pg II-268]</span>
to last several years. Just what must we make provision
for? Let us assume that the United States goes in with
all its men and resources&mdash;that we dedicate all our money,
our manufacturing plants, our army, our navy, everything
we have got, to bringing the war to an end. How long
will it take?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour replied that it would be necessary to consult
his naval and military advisers before he answered
that question. He said that he would return in a day or
two and make an explicit statement. He did so and his
answer was this: Under these circumstances&mdash;that the
United States should make war to the full limit of its
power, in men and resources&mdash;the war could not be ended
until the summer or the autumn of 1919. Mr. McAdoo
put the same question in the same form to the French
and Italian Missions and obtained precisely the same
answer.</p>

<p>Page's papers show that Mr. Balfour, in the early stages
of American participation, regarded the financial situation
as the thing which chiefly threatened the success of
the Allied cause. So much greater emphasis has been
laid upon the submarine warfare that this may at first
seem rather a misreading of Great Britain's peril. Yet
the fact is that the high rate of exchange and the depredatory
U-boat represented almost identically the same
danger. The prospect that so darkened the horizon in
the spring of 1917 was the possible isolation of Great
Britain. England's weakness, as always, consisted in the
fact that she was an island, that she could not feed herself
with her own resources and that she had only about six
weeks' supply of food ahead of her at any one time. If
Germany could cut the lines of communication and so
prevent essential supplies from reaching British ports,
the population of Great Britain could be starved into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-269" id="page2-269"></a>[pg II-269]</span>
surrender in a very brief time, France would be overwhelmed,
and the triumph of the Prussian cause would
be complete. That the success of the German submarine
campaign would accomplish this result was a fact that the
popular mind readily grasped. What it did not so clearly
see, however, was that the financial collapse of Great
Britain would cut these lines of communication quite as
effectually as the submarine itself. The British were
practically dependent for their existence upon the food
brought from the United States, just as the Allied armies
were largely dependent upon the steel which came from
the great industrial plants of this country. If Great
Britain could not find the money with which to purchase
these supplies, it is quite apparent that they could not be
shipped. The collapse of British credit therefore would
have produced the isolation of the British Isles and led to
a British surrender, just as effectively as would the success
of the German submarine campaign.</p>

<p>As soon as Bernstorff was sent home, therefore, and the
participation of this country in the war became extremely
probable, Mr. Balfour took up the financial question with
Page.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
March 5, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The inquiries which I have made here about financial
conditions disclose an international situation which is
most alarming to the financial and industrial outlook of
the United States. England has not only to pay her own
war bills, but is obliged to finance her Allies as well. Up
to the present time she has done these tasks out of her
own capital. But she cannot continue her present extensive
purchases in the United States without shipping gold
as payment for them, and there are two reasons why she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-270" id="page2-270"></a>[pg II-270]</span>
cannot make large shipments of gold. In the first place,
both England and France must keep the larger part of the
gold they have to maintain issues of their paper at par;
and, in the second place, the German U-boat has made the
shipping of gold a dangerous procedure even if they had
it to ship. There is therefore a pressing danger that the
Franco-American and Anglo-American exchange will be
greatly disturbed; the inevitable consequence will be that
orders by all the Allied Governments will be reduced to
the lowest possible amount and that trans-Atlantic trade
will practically come to an end. The result of such a
stoppage will be a panic in the United States. The
world will therefore be divided into two hemispheres,
one of them, our own, will have the gold and the commodities;
the other, Great Britain and Europe, will need these
commodities, but it will have no money with which to
pay for them. Moreover, it will have practically no commodities
of its own to exchange for them. The financial
and commercial result will be almost as bad for the United
States as for Europe. We shall soon reach this condition
unless we take quick action to prevent it. Great Britain
and France must have a credit in the United States which
will be large enough to prevent the collapse of world trade
and the whole financial structure of Europe.</p>

<p>If the United States declare war against Germany, the
greatest help we could give Great Britain and its Allies
would be such a credit. If we should adopt this policy,
an excellent plan would be for our Government to make a
large investment in a Franco-British loan. Another plan
would be to guarantee such a loan. A great advantage
would be that all the money would be kept in the United
States. We could keep on with our trade and increase it,
till the war ends, and after the war Europe would purchase
food and an enormous supply of materials with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-271" id="page2-271"></a>[pg II-271]</span>
which to re&euml;quip her peace industries. We should thus
reap the profit of an uninterrupted and perhaps an enlarging
trade over a number of years and we should hold
their securities in payment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we keep nearly all the gold and
Europe cannot pay for re&euml;stablishing its economic life,
there may be a world-wide panic for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>Of course we cannot extend such a credit unless we go
to war with Germany. But is there no way in which our
Government might immediately and indirectly help the
establishment in the United States of a large Franco-British
credit without violating armed neutrality? I do
not know enough about our own reserve bank law to form
an opinion. But these banks would avert such a danger
if they were able to establish such a credit. Danger for
us is more real and imminent, I think, than the public on
either side the Atlantic understands. If it be not averted
before its manifestations become apparent, it will then be
too late to save the day.</p>

<p>The pressure of this approaching crisis, I am certain,
has gone beyond the ability of the Morgan financial agency
for the British and French governments. The financial
necessities of the Allies are too great and urgent for any
private agency to handle, for every such agency has to
encounter business rivalries and sectional antagonisms.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the only way of maintaining
our present pre&euml;minent trade position and averting a
panic is by declaring war on Germany. The submarine
has added the last item to the danger of a financial world
crash. There is now an uncertainty about our being
drawn into the war; no more considerable credits can be
privately placed in the United States. In the meantime
a collapse may come.</p>

<p>PAGE.</p></div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-272" id="page2-272"></a>[pg II-272]</span></div>
<p>Urgent as this message was, it really understated the
desperate condition of British and Allied finances. That
the warring powers were extremely pressed for money
has long been known; but Page's papers reveal for the first
time the fact that they were facing the prospect of bankruptcy
itself. &quot;The whole Allied combination on this
side the ocean are very much nearer the end of their
financial resources,&quot; he wrote in July, &quot;than anybody has
guessed or imagined. We only can save them....
The submarines are steadily winning the war. Pershing
and his army have bucked up the French for the moment.
But for his coming there was more or less danger of a
revolution in Paris and of serious defection in the army.
Everybody here fears that the French will fail before
another winter of the trenches. Yet&mdash;the Germans must
be still worse off.&quot;</p>

<p>The matter that was chiefly pressing at the time of the
Balfour visit was the fact that the British balances in the
New York banks were in a serious condition. It should
always be remembered, however, that Great Britain was
financing not only herself, but her Allies, and that the
difficult condition in which she now found herself was
caused by the not too considerate demands of the nations
with which she was allied in the war. Thus by April 6,
1917, Great Britain had overdrawn her account with J.P.
Morgan to the extent of $400,000,000 and had no cash
available with which to meet this overdraft. This obligation
had been incurred in the purchase of supplies, both
for Great Britain and the allied governments; and securities,
largely British owned stocks and bonds, had been
deposited to protect the bankers. The money was now
coming due; if the obligations were not met, the credit of
Great Britain in this country would reach the vanishing
point. Though at first there was a slight misunderstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-273" id="page2-273"></a>[pg II-273]</span>
about this matter, the American Government
finally paid this over-draft out of the proceeds of the first
Liberty Loan. This act saved the credit of the allied
countries; it was, of course, only the beginning of the
financial support that America brought to the allied cause;
the advances that were afterward furnished from the
American Treasury made possible the purchases of food
and supplies in enormous quantities. The first danger
that threatened, the isolation and starvation of Great
Britain, was therefore overcome. It was the joint product
of Page's work in London and that of the Balfour
Commission in the United States.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Until these financial arrangements had been made
there was no certainty that the supplies which were
so essential to victory would ever leave the United States;
this obstruction at the source had now been removed.
But the greater difficulty still remained. The German
submarines were lying off the waters south and west of
Ireland ready to sink the supply ships as soon as they entered
the prohibited zone. Mr. Balfour and his associates
were working also on this problem in Washington; and,
at the same time, Page and Admiral Sims and the British
Admiralty were bending all their energies in London to
obtain immediate co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>A remark which Mr. Balfour afterward made to Admiral
Sims shows the frightful nature of the problem which was
confronting Great Britain at that time.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a terrible week we spent at sea in that
voyage to the United States,&quot; Mr. Balfour said. &quot;We knew
that the German submarine campaign was succeeding.
Their submarines were destroying our shipping and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-274" id="page2-274"></a>[pg II-274]</span>
had no means of preventing it. I could not help thinking
that we were facing the defeat of Great Britain.&quot;</p>

<p>Page's papers show that as early as February 25th he
understood in a general way the disheartening proportions
of the German success. &quot;It is a momentous crisis,&quot;
he wrote at that time. &quot;The submarines are destroying
shipping at an appalling rate.&quot; Yet it was not until
Admiral Sims arrived in London, on April 9th, that the
Ambassador learned all the details. In sending the Admiral
to England the Navy Department had acted on an
earnest recommendation from Page. The fact that the
American Navy was inadequately represented in the
British capital had long been a matter of embarrassment
to him. The ability and personal qualifications of our
attach&eacute;s had been unquestioned; but none of them during
the war had been men of high rank, and this in itself
proved to be a constant impediment to their success.
While America was represented by Commanders, Japan,
Italy, and France had all sent Admirals to London.
Page's repeated requests for an American Admiral had so
far met with no response, but the probability that this
country would become involved in the war now gave new
point to his representations. In the latter part of March,
Page renewed his request in still more urgent form, and
this time the President and the Navy Department responded
favourably. The result was that, on April 9th,
three days after the American declaration of war, Admiral
Sims and his flag-lieutenant, Commander Babcock,
presented themselves at the American Embassy. There
was little in the appearance of these men to suggest a violent
naval demonstration against Germany. Both wore
civilian dress, their instructions having commanded them
not to bring uniforms; both were travelling under assumed
names, and both had no more definite orders than to investigate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-275" id="page2-275"></a>[pg II-275]</span>
the naval situation and cable the results to
Washington. In spite of these attempts at secrecy, the
British had learned that Admiral Sims was on the way;
they rejoiced not only in this fact, but in the fact that
Sims had been chosen, for there was no American naval
officer whose professional reputation stood so high in the
British Navy or who was so personally acceptable to
British officialdom and the British public. The Admiralty
therefore met Admiral Sims at Liverpool, brought him
to London in a special train, and, a few hours after his
arrival, gave him the innermost secrets on the submarine
situation&mdash;secrets which were so dangerous that not all the
members of the British Cabinet had been let into them.</p>

<p>Page welcomed Admiral Sims with a cordiality which
that experienced sea veteran still gratefully remembers.
He at once turned over to him two rooms in the Embassy.
&quot;You can have everything we've got,&quot; the Ambassador
said. &quot;If necessary to give you room, we'll turn the whole
Embassy force out into the street.&quot; The two men had
not previously met, but in an instant they became close
friends. A common sympathy and a common enthusiasm
were greatly needed at that crisis. As soon as Admiral
Sims had finished his interview with Admiral Jellicoe, he
immediately sought out the Ambassador and laid all the
facts before him. Germany was winning the war. Great
Britain had only six weeks' food supply on hand, and the
submarines were sinking the ships at a rate which, unless
the depredations should be checked, meant an early and
unconditional surrender of the British Empire. Only the
help of the United States could prevent this calamity.</p>

<p>Page, of course, was aghast: the facts and figures Admiral
Sims gave him disclosed a situation which was even
more desperate than he had imagined. He advised the
Admiral to cable the whole story immediately to Washington.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-276" id="page2-276"></a>[pg II-276]</span>
Admiral Sims at first had some difficulty in obtaining
the Admiralty's consent to doing this, and the
reason was the one with which Page had long been familiar&mdash;the
fear, altogether too justified, that the news would
&quot;leak&quot; out of Washington. Of course there was no suspicion
in British naval circles of the good faith of the
Washington officials, but important facts had been sent
so many times under the seal of the strictest secrecy and
had then found their way into the newspapers that there
was a deep distrust of American discretion. Certainly
no greater damage could have been done the allied cause
at that time than to have the Germans learn how successfully
their submarine campaign was progressing. The
question was referred to the Imperial War Council and
its consent obtained. The report, however, was sent to
the Navy Department in the British naval code, and decoded
in the British Embassy in Washington.</p>

<p>Admiral Sims's message gave all the facts about the
submarine situation, and concluded with the recommendation
that the United States should assemble all floating
craft that could be used in the anti-submarine warfare,
destroyers, tugs, yachts, light cruisers, and similar vessels,
and send them immediately to Queenstown, where they
would do valuable service in convoying merchant vessels
and destroying the U-boats. At that time the American
Navy had between fifty and sixty destroyers that were
patrolling the American coast; these could have been despatched,
almost immediately, to the scene of operations;
but, in response to this request, the Department sent six
to Queentown.</p>

<p>The next few months were very unhappy ones for
Admiral Sims. He was the representative in London of
one of the world's greatest naval powers, participating in
the greatest war that had ever enlisted its energies, yet his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-277" id="page2-277"></a>[pg II-277]</span>
constant appeals for warships elicited the most inadequate
response, his well-reasoned recommendations for
meeting the crisis were frequently unanswered and at other
times were met with counter-proposals so childish that
they seemed almost to have originated in the brains of
newspaper amateurs, and his urgent pictures of a civilization
rapidly going to wreck were apparently looked upon
with suspicion as the utterances of a man who had been
completely led astray by British guile. To give a fair
idea of Washington's neglect during this period it is only
necessary to point out that, for four months, Admiral
Sims occupied the two rooms in the Embassy directly
above Page's, with Commander Babcock as his only aid.
Sims's repeated requests to Secretary Daniels for an
additional staff went unheeded. Had it not been for the
Admiral's constant daily association with Page and the
comfort and encouragement which the Ambassador gave
him, this experience would have been almost unbearable.
In the latter part of April, the Admiral's appeals to Washington
having apparently fallen on deaf ears, he asked
Page to second his efforts. The Admiral and Commander
Babcock wrote another message, and drove in a motor
car to Brighton, where Page was taking a little rest. The
Admiral did not know just how strong a statement the
Ambassador would care to sponsor, and so he did not make
this representation as emphatic as the judgment of both
men would have preferred.</p>

<p>The Admiral handed Page the paper, saying that he
had prepared it with the hope that the Ambassador would
sign it and send it directly to President Wilson.</p>

<p>&quot;It is quite apparent,&quot; Admiral Sims said, &quot;that the
Department doesn't believe what I have been saying.
Or they don't believe what the British are saying. They
think that England is exaggerating the peril for reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-278" id="page2-278"></a>[pg II-278]</span>
of its own. They think I am hopelessly pro-British and
that I am being used. But if you'll take it up directly
with the President, then they may be convinced.&quot;</p>

<p>Page put on his spectacles, took the paper, and read it
through. Then, looking over the rim of his glasses in his
characteristic way, he leaned toward Admiral Sims and
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Admiral, it isn't half strong enough! I think I can
write a better despatch than that, myself! At least let
me try.&quot;</p>

<p>He immediately took a pen and paper and in a few
minutes he had written his own version which he gave
the Admiral to read. The latter was delighted with it
and in a brief time it was on its way to Washington.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Very confidential for Secretary and President</i></p>

<p>There is reason for the greatest alarm about the issue
of the war caused by the increasing success of the German
submarines. I have it from official sources that during
the week ending 22nd April, 88 ships of 237,000 tons, allied
and neutral, were lost. The number of vessels unsuccessfully
attacked indicated a great increase in the number
of submarines in action.</p>

<p>This means practically a million tons lost every month
till the shorter days of autumn come. By that time the
sea will be about clear of shipping. Most of the ships are
sunk to the westward and southward of Ireland. The
British have in that area every available anti-submarine
craft, but their force is so insufficient that they hardly
discourage the submarines.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-279" id="page2-279"></a>[pg II-279]</span>
<p>The British transport of troops and supplies is already
strained to the utmost, and the maintenance of the armies
in the field is threatened. There is food enough here to
last the civil population only not more than six weeks or
two months.</p>

<p>Whatever help the United States may render at any
time in the future, or in any theatre of the war, our help
is now more seriously needed in this submarine area for
the sake of all the Allies than it can ever be needed again,
or anywhere else.</p>

<p>After talking over this critical situation with the Prime
Minister and other members of the Government, I can not
refrain from most strongly recommending the immediate
sending over of every destroyer and all other craft that
can be of anti-submarine use. This seems to me the
sharpest crisis of the war, and the most dangerous situation
for the Allies that has arisen or could arise.</p>

<p>If enough submarines can be destroyed in the next two
or three months, the war will be won, and if we can contribute
effective help immediately, it will be won directly
by our aid. I cannot exaggerate the pressing and increasing
danger of this situation. Thirty or more destroyers
and other similar craft sent by us immediately would very
likely be decisive.</p>

<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
London, May 4, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Mr. President:</p>

<p>The submarines have become a very grave danger.
The loss of British and allied tonnage increases with the
longer and brighter days&mdash;as I telegraphed you, 237,000
tons last week; and the worst of it is, the British are not
destroying them. The Admiralty publishes a weekly report
which, though true, is not the whole truth. It is
known in official circles here that the Germans are turning
out at least two a week&mdash;some say three; and the British
are not destroying them as fast as new ones are turned
out. If merely the present situation continue, the war
will pretty soon become a contest of endurance under
hunger, with an increasing proportion of starvation. Germany
is yet much the worse off, but it will be easily
possible for Great Britain to suffer to the danger point
next winter or earlier unless some decided change be
wrought in this situation.</p>

<p>The greatest help, I hope, can come from us&mdash;our destroyers
and similar armed craft&mdash;provided we can send
enough of them quickly. The area to be watched is so
big that many submarine hunters are needed. Early in
the war the submarines worked near shore. There are very
many more of them now and their range is one hundred
miles, or even two hundred, at sea.</p>

<p>The public is becoming very restive with its half
information, and it is more and more loudly demanding
all the facts. There are already angry threats to change
the personnel of the Admiralty; there is even talk of
turning out the Government. &quot;We must have results, we
must have results.&quot; I hear confidentially that Jellicoe
has threatened to resign unless the Salonica expedition is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-281" id="page2-281"></a>[pg II-281]</span>
brought back: to feed and equip that force requires too
many ships.</p>

<p>And there are other troubles impending. Norway has
lost so many of her ships that she dare not send what are
left to sea. Unarmed they'll all perish. If she arms them,
Germany will declare war against her. There is a plan
on foot for the British to charter these Norwegian ships
and to arm them, taking the risk of German war against
Norway. If war comes (as it is expected) England must
then defend Norway the best she can. And <i>then England
may ask for our big ships to help in these waters</i>. All this
is yet in the future, but possibly not far in the future.</p>

<p>For the present the only anti-submarine help is the help
we may be able to give to patrol the wide area off Ireland.
If we had one hundred destroyers to send, the job there
could, I am told, be quickly done. A third of that number
will help mightily. At the present rate of destruction
more than four million tons will be sunk before the summer
is gone.</p>

<p>Such is this dire submarine danger. The English
thought that they controlled the sea; the Germans, that
they were invincible on land. Each side is losing where
it thought itself strongest.</p>

<p>Admiral Sims is of the greatest help imaginable. Of
course, I gave him an office in one of our Embassy buildings,
and the Admiralty has given him an office also with
them. He spends much of his time there, and they have
opened all doors and all desks and drawers to him. He
strikes me (and the English so regard him) as a man of
admirable judgment&mdash;unexcitable and indefatigable. I
hope we'll soon send a general over, to whom the War
Department will act similarly. Hoover, too, must have a
good man here as, I dare say, he has already made known.
These will cover the Navy, the Army, Food, and Shipping.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-282" id="page2-282"></a>[pg II-282]</span>
Perhaps a Censor and an Intelligence (Secret Service)
group ought to come. I mean these for permanent&mdash;at
least indefinite&mdash;service. Exchange visits by a Congressional
Committee (such as the French and British
make) and by high official persons such as members of
your Cabinet (such also as the French and British make)&mdash;you
will have got ideas about these from Mr. Balfour.</p>

<p>W.H.P.</p></div>

<p>In the latter part of June Admiral Sims went to Queenstown.
Admiral Bayly, who directed the operation of the
anti-submarine forces there, had gone away for a brief
rest, and Admiral Sims had taken over the command of
both the British and American forces at that point. This
experience gave Admiral Sims a first-hand picture of a
really deplorable situation. The crisis was so desperate
that he made another appeal to Page.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>From Admiral William S. Sims</i><br />
<br />
Admiralty House, Queenstown,<br />
June 25, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My Dear Mr. Page:</p>

<p>I enclose herewith a letter on the submarine situation<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61" /><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p>I think I have made it plain therein that the Allies are
losing the war; that it will be already lost when the loss
of shipping reaches the point where fully adequate supplies
cannot be maintained on the various battle fronts.</p>

<p>I cannot understand why our Government should hesitate
to send the necessary anti-submarine craft to this side.</p>

<p>There are at least seventeen more destroyers employed
on our Atlantic coast, <i>where there is no war</i>, not to mention
numerous other very useful anti-submarine craft, including
sea-going tugs, etc.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-283" id="page2-283"></a>[pg II-283]</span>
<p>Can you not do something to bring our Government to
an understanding of how very serious the situation is?
Would it not be well to send another telegram to Mr.
Lansing and the President, and also send them the enclosed
correspondence?</p>

<p>I am sending this by mail because I may be somewhat
delayed in returning to London.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Very sincerely yours,<br />
<br />
Wm. S. Sims.<br />
</div>

<p>Page immediately acted on this suggestion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Most confidential for the Secretary of State and
President only</i></p>

<p>Sims sends me by special messenger from Queenstown
the most alarming reports of the submarine situation
which are confirmed by the Admiralty here. He says that
the war will be won or lost in this submarine zone within
a few months. Time is of the essence of the problem, and
anti-submarine craft which cannot be assembled in the
submarine zone almost immediately may come too late.
There is, therefore, a possibility that this war may become
a war between Germany and the United States alone.
Help is far more urgently and quickly needed in this submarine
zone than anywhere else in the whole war area.</p>

<p>Page.</p></div>

<p>The United States had now been in the war for three
months and only twenty-eight of the sixty destroyers which
were available had been sent into the field. Yet this
latest message of Page produced no effect, and, when
Admiral Sims returned from Queenstown, the two men,
almost in despair, consulted as to the step which they
should take next. What was the matter? Was it that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-284" id="page2-284"></a>[pg II-284]</span>
Washington did not care to get into the naval war with its
full strength, or was it that it simply refused to believe
the representations of its Admiral and its Ambassador?
Admiral Sims and Page went over the whole situation
and came to the conclusion that Washington regarded
them both as so pro-British that their reports were subject
to suspicion. Just as Page had found that the State
Department, and its &quot;trade advisers,&quot; had believed that
the British were using the blockade as a means of destroying
American trade for the benefit of Britain, so now
he believed that Mr. Daniels and Admiral Benson, the
Chief of Naval Operations, evidently thought that Great
Britain was attempting to lure American warships into
European waters, to undergo the risk of protecting British
commerce, while British warships were kept safely in
harbour. Page suggested that there was now only one
thing left to do, and that was to request the British
Government itself to make a statement to President
Wilson that would substantiate his own messages.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever else they think of the British in Washington,&quot;
he said, &quot;they know one thing&mdash;and that is that a
British statesman like Mr. Balfour will not lie.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour by this time had returned from America.
The fact that he had established these splendid personal
relations with Mr. Wilson, and that he had impressed the
American public so deeply with his sincerity and fine
purpose, made him especially valuable for this particular
appeal. Page and Admiral Sims therefore went to the
Foreign Office and laid all the facts before him. Their
own statements, Page informed the Foreign Secretary,
were evidently regarded as hysterical and biased by
an unreasoning friendliness to Great Britain. If Mr.
Balfour would say the same things over his own signature,
then they would not be disbelieved.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-285" id="page2-285"></a>[pg II-285]</span></div>
<p>Mr. Balfour gladly consented. He called in Admiral
Jellicoe and asked him to draft a despatch, so that all the
technical facts would be completely accurate. He also
consulted with Sir Edward Carson, the First Lord of the
Admiralty. Then Mr. Balfour put the document in its
final shape and signed it. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>Mr. Balfour to the President</i><br />
<br />
June 30, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The forces at present at the disposal of the British Admiralty
are not adequate to protect shipping from submarine
attack in the danger zone round the British Islands.
Consequently shipping is being sunk at a greater rate than
it can be replaced by new tonnage of British origin.</p>

<p>The time will come when, if the present rate of loss
continues, the available shipping, apart from American
contribution, will be insufficient to bring to this country
sufficient foodstuffs and other essentials, including oil fuel.
The situation in regard to our Allies, France, and Italy, is
much the same.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is absolutely necessary to add to our
forces as a first step, pending the adoption or completion
of measures which will, it is hoped, eventually lead to the
destruction of enemy submarines at a rate sufficient to
ensure safety of our sea communications.</p>

<p>The United States is the only allied country in a position
to help. The pressing need is for armed small craft
of every kind available in the area where commerce concentrates
near the British and French coasts. Destroyers,
submarines, gunboats, yachts, trawlers, and tugs
would all give invaluable help, and if sent in sufficient
numbers would undoubtedly save a situation which is
manifestly critical. But they are required now and in
as great numbers as possible. There is no time for delay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-286" id="page2-286"></a>[pg II-286]</span>
The present method of submarine attack is almost entirely
by torpedo with the submarine submerged. The
gun defense of merchant ships keeps the submarine below
the surface but does no more; offensively against a submerged
submarine it is useless, and the large majority of
the ships torpedoed never see the attacking submarine
until the torpedo has hit the ship<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62" /><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>The present remedy is, therefore, to prevent the submarine
from using its periscope for fear of attack by bomb
or ram from small craft, and this method of defense for the
shipping and offense against the submarine requires small
craft in very large numbers.</p>

<p>The introduction of the convoy system, provided there
are sufficient destroyers to form an adequate screen to the
convoy, will, it is hoped, minimize losses when it is working,
and the provision of new offensive measures is progressing;
but for the next few months there is only one
safeguard, viz., the immediate addition to patrols of
every small vessel that can possibly be sent to European
waters.</p></div>

<p>Page, moreover, kept up his own appeal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
July 5th.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Strictly confidential to the President and the Secretary</i></p>

<p>The British Cabinet is engaging in a threatening controversy
about the attitude which they should take toward
the submarine peril. There is a faction in the Admiralty
which possesses the indisputable facts and which takes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-287" id="page2-287"></a>[pg II-287]</span>
a very disheartening view of the situation. This group
insists that the Cabinet should make a confession at least
to us of the full extent of the danger and that it should
give more information to the public. The public does
not feel great alarm simply because it has been kept in
too great ignorance. But the political faction is so far the
stronger. It attempts to minimize the facts, and, probably
for political reasons, it refuses to give these discouraging
facts wide publicity. The politicians urge that it is necessary
to conceal the full facts from the Germans. They
also see great danger in throwing the public into a panic.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George is always optimistic and he is too
much inclined to yield his judgment to political motives.
In his recent address in Glasgow he gave the public a
comforting impression of the situation. But the facts do
not warrant the impression which he gave.</p>

<p>This dispute among the political factions is most unfortunate
and it may cause an explosion of public feeling
at any time. Changes in the Cabinet may come in consequence.
If the British public knew all the facts or if
the American people knew them, the present British Government
would probably fall. It is therefore not only the
submarine situation which is full of danger. The political
situation is in a dangerous state also.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>Since admirals and generals began to come from home,
they and the war have taken my time so completely, day
and night, that I haven't lately written you many things
that I should like to tell you. I'll try here&mdash;a house of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-288" id="page2-288"></a>[pg II-288]</span>
friend of ours where the only other guest besides your
mother and me is Edward Grey. This is the first time
I've seen him since he left office. Let me take certain big
subjects in order and come to smaller things later:</p>

<p>1. The German submarines are succeeding to a degree
that the public knows nothing about. These two things
are true: (a) The Germans are building submarines faster
than the English sink them. In this way, therefore, they
are steadily gaining. (b) The submarines are sinking
freight ships faster than freight ships are being built by
the whole world. In this way, too, then, the Germans are
succeeding. Now if this goes on long enough, the Allies'
game is up. For instance, they have lately sunk so
many fuel oil ships, that this country may very soon be in
a perilous condition&mdash;even the Grand Fleet may not have
enough fuel. Of course the chance is that oil ships will
not continue to fall victims to the U-boats and we shall
get enough through to replenish the stock. But this illustrates
the danger, and it is a very grave danger.</p>

<p>The best remedy so far worked out is the destroyer.
The submarines avoid destroyers and they sink very,
very few ships that are convoyed. If we had destroyers
enough to patrol the whole approach (for, say, 250 miles)
to England, the safety of the sea would be very greatly
increased; and if we had enough to patrol and to convoy
every ship going and coming, the damage would be reduced
to a minimum. The Admiral and I are trying our
best to get our Government to send over 500 improvised
destroyers&mdash;yachts, ocean-going tugs&mdash;any kind of swift
craft that can be armed. Five hundred such little boats
might end the war in a few months; for the Germans are
keeping the spirit of their people and of their army up
by their submarine success. If that success were stopped
they'd have no other cry half so effective. If they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-289" id="page2-289"></a>[pg II-289]</span>
see this in Washington as we see it, they'd do it and do it
not halfway but with a vengeance. If they don't do it,
the war may be indefinitely prolonged and a wholly
satisfactory peace may never be made. The submarine is
the most formidable thing the war has produced&mdash;by far&mdash;and
it gives the German the only earthly chance he has
to win. And he <i>may</i> substantially win by it yet. That's
what the British conceal. In fact, half of them do not see
it or believe it. But nothing is truer, or plainer. One
hundred thousand submarine chasers next year may be
worth far less than 500 would be worth now, for next year
see how few ships may be left! The mere arming of ships
is not enough. Nearly all that are sunk are armed. The
submarine now carries a little periscope and a big one,
each painted the colour of the sea. You can't see a little
periscope except in an ocean as smooth as glass. It isn't
bigger than a coffee cup. The submarine thus sinks its
victims without ever emerging or ever being seen. As
things now stand, the Germans are winning the war, and
they are winning it on the sea; that's the queer and the
most discouraging fact. My own opinion is that all
the facts ought to be published to all the world. Let the
Germans get all the joy they can out of the confession.
No matter, if the Government and the people of the
United States knew all the facts, we'd have 1,000 improvised
destroyers (yachts, tugs, etc., etc.) armed and over
here very quickly. Then the tide would turn.</p>

<p>Then there'd be nothing to fear in the long run. For
the military authorities all agree that the German Army is
inferior to the British and French and will be whipped.
That may take a long time yet; but of the result nobody
who knows seems to have any doubt&mdash;unless the French
get tired and stop. They have periods of great war weariness
and there is real danger that they may quit and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-290" id="page2-290"></a>[pg II-290]</span>
make a separate peace. General Pershing's presence has
made the situation safe for the moment. But in a little
while something else spectacular and hopeful may be required
to keep them in line.</p>

<p>Such is an accurate picture of the war as it is now, and
it is a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>2. The next grave danger is financial. The European
Allies have so bled the English for money that the English
would by this time probably have been on a paper money
basis (and of course all the Allies as well) if we had not
come to their financial aid. And we've got to keep our
financial aid going to them to prevent this disastrous result.
That wouldn't at once end the war, if they had all
abandoned specie payments; but it would be a frightfully
severe blow and it might later bring defeat. That is a real
danger. And the Government at Washington, I fear,
does not know the full extent of the danger. They think
that the English are disposed to lie down on them. They
don't realize the cost of the war. This Government has
bared all this vast skeleton to me; but I fear that Washington
imagines that part of it is a deliberate scare. It's
a very real danger.</p>

<p>Now, certain detached items:</p>

<p>Sims is the idol of the British Admiralty and he is doing
his job just as well as any man could with the tools and
the chance that he has. He has made the very best of the
chance and he has completely won the confidence and
admiration of this side of the world.</p>

<p>Pershing made an admirable impression here, and in
France he has simply set them wild with joy. His coming
and his little army have been worth what a real army
will be worth later. It is well he came to keep the French
in line.</p>

<p>The army of doctors and nurses have had a similar effect.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-291" id="page2-291"></a>[pg II-291]</span>
<p>Even the New England saw-mill units have caused
a furor of enthusiasm. They came with absolute Yankee
completeness of organization&mdash;with duplicate parts of all
their machinery, tents, cooks, pots, and pans, and everything
ship-shape. The only question they asked was:
&quot;Say, where the hell are them trees you want sawed up?&quot;
That's the way to do a job! Yankee stock is made high
here by such things as that.</p>

<p>We're getting a crowd of Yankee lecturers on the
United States to go up and down this Kingdom. There's
the greatest imaginable curiosity to hear about the United
States in all kinds of society from munition workers
to universities. I got the British Government to write
Buttrick<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63" /><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> to come as its guest, and the Rockefeller Boards
rose to the occasion. He'll probably be along presently.
If he hasn't already sailed when you get this, see him and
tell him to make arrangements to have pictures sent over
to him to illustrate his lectures. Who else could come
to do this sort of a job?</p>

<p>I am myself busier than I have ever been. The kind
of work the Embassy now has to do is very different from
the work of the days of neutrality. It continues to
increase&mdash;especially the work that I have to do myself.
But it's all pleasant now. We are trying to help and no
longer to hinder. To save my life I don't see how the
Washington crowd can look at themselves in a mirror and
keep their faces straight. Yesterday they were bent on
sending everything into European neutral states. The
foundations of civilization would give way if neutral trade
were interfered with. Now, nothing must go in except on
a ration basis. Yesterday it must be a peace without
victory. Now it must be a complete victory, every man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-292" id="page2-292"></a>[pg II-292]</span>
and every dollar thrown in, else no peace is worth having.
I don't complain. I only rejoice. But I'm glad that
kind of a rapid change is not a part of my record. The
German was the same beast yesterday that he is to-day;
and it makes a simple-minded, straight-minded man
like me wonder which attitude was the (or is the) attitude
of real conviction. But this doesn't bother me now as a
real problem&mdash;only as a speculation. What we call History
will, I presume, in time work this out. But History
is often a kind of lie. But never mind that. The only
duty of mankind now is to win. Other things can wait.</p>

<p>I walked over to Stonehenge and back (about six miles)
with Lord Grey (Sir Edward, you know) and we, like everybody
else, fell to talking about when the war may end.
We know as well as anybody and no better than anybody
else. I have very different moods about it&mdash;no convictions.
It seems to me to depend, as things now are,
more on the submarines than on anything else. If we
could effectually discourage them so that the Germans
would have to withdraw them and could no more keep
up the spirit of their people by stories of the imminent
starvation of England, I have a feeling that the hunger
and the war weariness of the German people would lead
them to force an end. But, the more they are called on
to suffer the more patriotic do they think themselves and
they <i>may</i> go on till they drop dead in their tracks.</p>

<p>What I am really afraid of is that the Germans may,
before winter, offer all that the Western Allies most want&mdash;the
restoration of Belgium and France, the return of
Alsace-Lorraine, etc., in the West and the surrender of
the Colonies&mdash;provided Austria is not dismembered. That
would virtually leave them the chance to work out their
Middle Europe scheme and ultimately there'd probably
have to be another war over that question. That's the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-293" id="page2-293"></a>[pg II-293]</span>
real eventuality to be feared&mdash;a German defeat in the
West but a German victory in the Southeast. Everybody
in Europe is so war weary that such a plan <i>may</i> succeed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what Hoover and Northcliffe fear
may come true&mdash;that the Germans are going to keep up
the struggle for years&mdash;till their armies are practically
obliterated, as Lee's army was. If the Allies were actually
to kill (not merely wound, but actually kill) 5,000 Germans
a day for 300 days a year, it would take about
four years to obliterate the whole German Army. There
is the bare possibility, therefore, of a long struggle yet.
But I can't believe it. My dominant mood these days is
an end within a very few months after the submarines are
knocked out. Send over, therefore, 1,000 improvised
destroyers the next two months, and I'll promise peace
by Christmas. Otherwise I can make no promises.
That's all that Lord Grey and I know, and surely we are
two wise men. What, therefore, is the use in writing
any more about this?</p>

<p>The chief necessity that grows upon me is that all the
facts must be brought out that show the kinship in blood
and ideals of the two great English-speaking nations.
We were actually coming to believe ourselves that we were
part German and Slovene and Pole and What-not, instead
of essentially being Scotch and English. Hence the unspeakable
impudence of your German who spoke of eliminating
the Anglo-Saxon element from American life! The
truth should be forcibly and convincingly told and repeated
to the end of the chapter, and our national life
should proceed on its natural historic lines, with its
proper historic outlook and background. We can do
something to bring this about.</p></div>

<p>The labour of getting the American Navy into the war
was evidently at first a difficult one, but the determination
of Page and Admiral Sims triumphed, and, by August and
September, our energies were fully engaged. And the
American Navy made a record that will stand everlastingly

<h3>PAGE&mdash;THE MAN</h3>


<p>The entrance of America into the war, followed
by the successful promotion of the Balfour visit,
brought a period of quiet into Page's life. These events
represented for him a personal triumph; there were many
things still to be done, it is true, and Page, as always, was
active in advancing the interests that were nearest his
heart; yet the mighty relief that followed the American
declaration was the kind that one experiences after accomplishing
the greatest task of a lifetime. Page's letters
have contained many references to the sense of moral
isolation which his country's policy had forced upon him;
he probably exaggerated his feeling that there was a
tendency to avoid him; this was merely a reflection
of his own inclination to keep away from all but the
official people. He now had more leisure and certainly
more interest in cultivating the friends that he had
made in Great Britain. For the fact is that, during
all these engrossing years, Page had been more than
an Ambassador; by the time the United States entered
the war he had attained an assured personal position
in the life of the British capital. He had long since
demonstrated his qualifications for a post, which, in the
distinction of the men who have occupied it, has few
parallels in diplomacy. The scholarly Lowell, the courtly
Bayard, the companionable Hay, the ever-humorous
Choate, had set a standard for American Ambassadors
which had made the place a difficult one for their successors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-296" id="page2-296"></a>[pg II-296]</span>
Though Page had characteristics in common
with all these men, his personality had its own distinctive
tang; and it was something new to the political and
social life of London. And the British capital, which is
extremely exacting and even merciless in its demands upon
its important personages, had found it vastly entertaining.
&quot;I didn't know there could be anything so American
as Page except Mark Twain,&quot; a British literary man
once remarked; and it was probably this strong American
quality, this directness and even breeziness of speech
and of method, this absence of affectation, this almost
openly expressed contempt for finesse and even for tradition,
combined with those other traits which we like to
think of as American&mdash;an upright purpose, a desire to
serve not only his own country but mankind&mdash;which
made the British public look upon Page as one of the
most attractive and useful figures in a war-torn Europe.</p>

<p>There was a certain ruggedness in Page's exterior which
the British regarded as distinctly in keeping with this American
flavour. The Ambassador was not a handsome man.
To one who had heard much of the liveliness of his conversation
and presence a first impression was likely to be
disappointing. His figure at this time was tall, gaunt, and
lean&mdash;and he steadily lost weight during his service in
England; his head was finely shaped&mdash;it was large, with a
high forehead, his thin gray hair rather increasing its
intellectual aspect; and his big frank brown eyes reflected
that keen zest for life, that unsleeping interest in everything
about him, that ever-working intelligence and sympathy
which were the man's predominant traits. But a very large
nose at first rather lessened the pleasing effects of his other
features, and a rather weather-beaten, corrugated face
gave a preliminary suggestion of roughness. Yet Page
had only to begin talking and the impression immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-297" id="page2-297"></a>[pg II-297]</span>
changed. &quot;He puts his mind to yours,&quot; Dr. Johnson
said, describing the sympathetic qualities of a friend, and
the same was true of Page. Half a dozen sentences,
spoken in his quick, soft, and ingratiating accents,
accompanied by the most genial smile, at once converted
the listener into a friend. Few men have ever lived
who more quickly responded to this human relationship.
The Ambassador, at the simple approach of a
human being, became as a man transformed. Tired
though he might be, low in spirits as he not infrequently
was, the press of a human hand at once changed him into
an animated and radiating companion. This responsiveness
deceived all his friends in the days of his last illness.
His intimates who dropped in to see Page invariably
went away much encouraged and spread optimistic reports
about his progress. A few minutes' conversation
with Page would deceive even his physicians. The explanation
was a simple one: the human presence had an
electric effect upon him, and it is a revealing sidelight on
Page's character that almost any man or woman could
produce this result. As an editor, the readiness with
which he would listen to suggestions from the humblest
source was a constant astonishment to his associates.
The office boy had as accessible an approach to Page
as had his partners. He never treated an idea, even a
grotesque one, with contempt; he always had time to
discuss it, to argue it out, and no one ever left his presence
thinking that he had made an absurd proposal. Thus
Page had a profound respect for a human being simply
because he was a human being; the mere fact that a man,
woman, or child lived and breathed, had his virtues and
his failings, constituted in Page's imagination a tremendous
fact. He could not wound such a living creature
any more than he could wound a flower or a tree;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-298" id="page2-298"></a>[pg II-298]</span>
consequently he treated every person as an important member
of the universe. Not infrequently, indeed, he stormed
at public men, but his thunder, after all, was not very
terrifying; his remarks about such personages as Mr.
Bryan merely reflected his indignation at their policies and
their influence but did not indicate any feeling against the
victims themselves. Page said &quot;Good morning&quot; to his
doorman with the same deference that he showed to Sir
Edward Grey, and there was not a little stenographer in
the building whose joys and sorrows did not arouse in him
the most friendly interest. Some of the most affecting
letters written about Page, indeed, have come from these
daily associates of more humble station. &quot;We so often
speak of Mr. Page,&quot; writes one of the Embassy staff&mdash;&quot;Findlater,
Short, and Frederick&quot;&mdash;these were all English
servants at the Embassy; &quot;we all loved him equally,
and hardly a day passes that something does not remind
us of him, and I often fancy that I hear his laugh, so full
of kindness and love of life.&quot; And the impression left
on those in high position was the same. &quot;I have seen
ladies representing all that is most worldly in Mayfair,&quot;
writes Mr. Ellery Sedgwick, the editor of the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, &quot;start at the sudden thought of Page's illness,
their eyes glistening with tears.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps what gave most charm to this human side was
the fact that Page was fundamentally such a scholarly
man. This was the aspect which especially delighted
his English friends. He preached democracy and Americanism
with an emphasis that almost suggested the back-woodsman&mdash;the
many ideas on these subjects that appear
in his letters Page never hesitated to set forth with all due
resonance at London dinner tables&mdash;yet he phrased his
creed in language that was little less than literary style,
and illuminated it with illustrations and a philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-299" id="page2-299"></a>[pg II-299]</span>
that were the product of the most exhaustive reading.
&quot;Your Ambassador has taught us something that we did
not know before,&quot; an English friend remarked to an
American. &quot;That is that a man can be a democrat and a
man of culture at the same time.&quot; The Greek and Latin
authors had been Page's companions from the days when,
as the holder of the Greek Fellowship at Johns Hopkins,
he had been a favourite pupil of Basil L. Gildersleeve.
British statesmen who had been trained at Balliol, in the
days when Greek was the indispensable ear-mark of a
gentleman, could thus meet their American associate on
the most sympathetic terms. Page likewise spoke a
brand of idiomatic English which immediately put him
in a class by himself. He regarded words as sacred things.
He used them, in his writing or in his speech, with the
utmost care and discrimination; yet this did not result in
a halting or stilted style; he spoke with the utmost ease,
going rapidly from thought to thought, choosing invariably
the one needful word, lighting up the whole with whimsicalities
all his own, occasionally emphasizing a good point
by looking downward and glancing over his eyeglasses,
perhaps, if he knew his companion intimately, now and
then giving him a monitory tap on the knee. Page, in
fact, was a great and incessant talker; hardly anything
delighted him more than a companionable exchange of
ideas and impressions; he was seldom so busy that he
would not push aside his papers for a chat; and he would
talk with almost any one, on almost any subject&mdash;his
secretaries, his stenographers, his office boys, and any
crank who succeeded in getting by the doorman&mdash;for, in
spite of his lively warnings against the breed, Page did
really love cranks and took a collector's joy in uncovering
new types. Page's voice was normally quiet; though he
had spent all his early life in the South, the characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-300" id="page2-300"></a>[pg II-300]</span>
Southern accents were ordinarily not observable; yet his
intonation had a certain gentleness that was probably an
inheritance of his Southern breeding. Thus, when he
first began talking, his words would ripple along quietly
and rapidly; a characteristic pose was to sit calmly, with
one knee thrown over the other, his hands folded; as his
interest increased, however, he would get up, perhaps
walk across the room, or stand before the fireplace, his
hands behind his back; a large cigar, sometimes unlighted,
at other times emitting huge clouds of smoke, would
oscillate from one side of his mouth to the other; his talk
would grow in earnestness, his voice grow louder, his
words come faster and faster, until finally they would
gush forth in a mighty torrent.</p>

<p>All Page's personal traits are explained by that one
characteristic which tempered all others, his sense of
humour. That Page was above all a serious-minded man
his letters show; yet his spirits were constantly alert for
the amusing, the grotesque, and the contradictory; like
all men who are really serious and alive to the pathos of
existence, he loved a hearty laugh, especially as he found
it a relief from the gloom that filled his every waking
moment in England. Page himself regarded this ability
to smile as an indispensable attribute to a well-rounded
life. &quot;No man can be a gentleman,&quot; he once declared,
&quot;who does not have a sense of humour.&quot; Only he who
possessed this gift, Page believed, had an imaginative
insight into the failings and the virtues of his brothers;
only he could have a tolerant attitude toward the stupidities
of his fellows, to say nothing of his own. And humour
with him assumed various shades; now it would flash in
an epigram, or smile indulgently at a passing human
weakness; now and then it would break out into genial
mockery; occasionally it would manifest itself as sheer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-301" id="page2-301"></a>[pg II-301]</span>
horse-play; and less frequently it would become sardonic
or even savage. It was in this latter spirit that he once
described a trio of Washington statesmen, whose influence
he abhorred as, &quot;three minds that occupy a single vacuum.&quot;
He once convulsed a Scottish audience by describing the
national motto of Scotland&mdash;and doing so with a broad burr
in his voice that seemed almost to mark the speaker a native
to the heath&mdash;as &quot;Liber-r-ty, fra-a-ternity and f-r-r-u-gality.&quot;
The policy of his country occasioned many awkward
moments which, thanks to his talent for amiable
raillery, he usually succeeded in rendering harmless. Not
infrequently Page's fellow guests at the dinner table would
think the American attitude toward Germany a not
inappropriate topic for small talk. &quot;Mr. Page,&quot; remarked
an exaltedly titled lady in a conversational pause,
&quot;when is your country going to get into the war?&quot; The
more discreet members of the company gasped, but Page
was not disturbed. &quot;Please give us at least ninety days,&quot;
he answered, and an exceedingly disagreeable situation was
thus relieved by general laughter.</p>

<p>On another occasion his repudiation of this flippant
spirit took a more solemn and even more effective form.
The time was a few days before the United States had
declared war. Bernstorff had been dismissed; events
were rapidly rushing toward the great climax; yet the
behaviour of the Washington Administration was still
inspiring much caustic criticism. The Pages were present
at one of the few dinners which they attended in
the course of this crisis; certain smart and tactless guests
did not seem to regard their presence as a bar to many
gibes against the American policy. Page sat through it
all impassive, never betraying the slightest resentment.</p>

<p>Presently the ladies withdrew. Page found himself
sitting next to Mr. Harold Nicolson, an important official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-302" id="page2-302"></a>[pg II-302]</span>
in the Foreign Office. It so happened that Mr. Nicolson
and Page were the only two members of the company who
were the possessors of a great secret which made ineffably
silly all the chatter that had taken place during the dinner;
this was that the United States had decided on war
against Germany and would issue the declaration in a
few days.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Nicolson,&quot; said Page, &quot;I think that you
and I will drink a glass of wine together.&quot;</p>

<p>The two men quietly lifted their glasses and drank the
silent toast. Neither made the slightest reference to the
forthcoming event. Perhaps the other men present were
a little mystified, but in a few days they understood what
it had meant, and also learned how effectively they had
been rebuked.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it any wonder,&quot; says Mr. Nicolson, telling this
story, &quot;that I think that Mr. Page is perhaps the greatest
gentleman I have ever known? He has only one possible
competitor for this distinction&mdash;and that is Arthur Balfour.&quot;</p>

<p>The English newspapers took delight in printing Page's
aphorisms, and several anecdotes that came from America
afforded them especial joy. One went back to the days
when the Ambassador was editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.
A woman contributor had sent him a story; like most
literary novices she believed that editors usually rejected
the manuscripts of unknown writers without reading them.
She therefore set a trap for Page by pasting together certain
sheets. The manuscript came back promptly, and,
as the prospective contributor had hoped, these sheets
had not been disturbed. These particular sections had
certainly not been read. The angry author triumphantly
wrote to Page, explaining how she had caught him and
denouncing the whole editorial tribe as humbugs. &quot;Dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-303" id="page2-303"></a>[pg II-303]</span>
Madam,&quot; Page immediately wrote in reply, &quot;when I
break an egg at breakfast, I do not have to eat the whole
of it to find out that it is bad.&quot; Page's treatment of
authors, however, was by no means so acrimonious as this
little note might imply. Indeed, the urbanity and
consideration shown in his correspondence with writers had
long been a tradition in American letters. The remark of
O. Henry in this regard promises to become immortal:
&quot;Page could reject a story with a letter that was so
complimentary,&quot; he said, &quot;and make everybody feel so happy
that you could take it to a bank and borrow money on it.&quot;</p>

<p>Another anecdote reminiscent of his editorial days was
his retort to S.S. McClure, the editor of <i>McClure's Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Page,&quot; said Mr. McClure, &quot;there are only three great
editors in the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who's the third one, Sam?&quot; asked Page.</p>

<p>Plenty of stories, illustrating Page's quickness and
aptness in retort, have gathered about his name in England.
Many of them indicate a mere spirit of boyish
fun. Early in his Ambassadorship he was spending a
few days at Stratford-on-Avon, his hostess being an
American woman who had beautifully restored an Elizabethan
house; the garden contained a mulberry tree
which she liked to think had been planted by Shakespeare
himself. The dignitaries of Stratford, learning that
the American Ambassador had reached town, asked
permission to wait upon him; the Lord Mayor, who headed
the procession, made an excellent speech, to which Page
appropriately replied, and several hundred people were
solemnly presented. After the party had left Page
turned to his hostess:</p>

<p>&quot;Have they all gone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-304" id="page2-304"></a>[pg II-304]</span></div>
<p>&quot;All?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let's take hands and dance around the mulberry
tree!&quot;</p>

<p>Page was as good as his word; he danced as gaily as the
youngest member of the party, to the singing of the old
English song.</p>

<p>The great service in St. Paul's Cathedral, in commemoration
of America's entry into the war, has already been
described. A number of wounded Americans, boys whose
zeal for the Allies had led them to enlist in the Canadian
Army, were conspicuous participants in this celebration.
After the solemn religious ceremonies, the Ambassador
and these young men betook themselves for lunch to a
well-known London restaurant. In an interval of the
conversation one of the Americans turned to Page.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Ambassador, there was just one thing wrong
with that service.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We wanted to yell, and we couldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why don't you yell now?&quot;</p>

<p>The boy jumped on a chair and began waving his napkin.
&quot;The Ambassador says we may yell,&quot; he cried.
&quot;Let's yell!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so,&quot; said Page, telling the story, &quot;they yelled for
five minutes and I yelled with them. We all felt better
in consequence.&quot;</p>

<p>This geniality, this disposition not to take life too
solemnly, sometimes lightened up the sombre atmosphere
of the Foreign Office itself. &quot;Mr. Balfour went on
a sort of mild rampage yesterday,&quot; Page records. &quot;The
British and American navies had come to an arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-305" id="page2-305"></a>[pg II-305]</span>
whereby the Brazilian ships that are coming over to help
us fight should join the American unit, not the British,
as was at first proposed. Washington telegraphed me
that the British Minister at Rio was blocking the game
by standing out for the first British idea&mdash;that the Brazilian
ships should join the British. It turned out in the
conversation that the British Minister had not been
informed of the British-American naval arrangement.
Mr. Balfour sent for Lord Hardinge. He called in one
of the private secretaries. Was such a thing ever heard
of?</p>

<p>&quot;Did you ever know,' said the indignant Mr. Balfour,
turning to me, 'of such a thing as a minister not even being
informed of his Government's decisions?' 'Yes,' I
said, 'if I ransack my memory diligently, I think I could
find such cases.' The meeting went into laughter!&quot;</p>

<p>Evidently the troubles which Page was having with his
own State Department were not unfamiliar to British
officialdom.</p>

<p>Page's letters sufficiently reveal his fondness for Sir
Edward Grey and the splendid relations that existed between
them. The sympathetic chords which the two
men struck upon their first meeting only grew stronger with
time. A single episode brings out the bonds that drew
them together. It took place at a time when the
tension over the blockade was especially threatening.
One afternoon Page asked for a formal interview; he had
received another exceedingly disagreeable protest from
Washington, with instructions to push the matter to a
decision; the Ambassador left his Embassy with a grave
expression upon his face; his associates were especially
worried over the outcome. So critical did the situation
seem that the most important secretaries gathered in the
Ambassador's room, awaiting his return, their nerves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-306" id="page2-306"></a>[pg II-306]</span>
strung almost to the breaking point. An hour went by
and nothing was heard from Page; another hour slowly
passed and still the Ambassador did not return. The
faces of the assembled staff lengthened as the minutes
went by; what was the Ambassador doing at the Foreign
Office? So protracted an interview could portend only
evil; already, in the minds of these nervous young men,
ultimatums were flying between the United States and
Great Britain, and even war might be hanging in the
balance. Another hour drew out its weary length; the
room became dark, dinner time was approaching, and still
Page failed to make his appearance. At last, when his
distracted subordinates were almost prepared to go in
search of their chief, the Ambassador walked jauntily in,
smiling and apparently carefree. What had happened?
What was to be done about the detained ships?</p>

<p>&quot;What ships?&quot; asked Page, and then suddenly he remembered.
&quot;Oh, yes&mdash;those.&quot; That was all right; Sir
Edward had at once promised to release them; it had all
been settled in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why were you so long?&quot;</p>

<p>The truth came out: Sir Edward and Page had quickly
turned from intercepted cargoes to the more congenial
subject of Wordsworth, Tennyson, and other favourite
poets, and the rest of the afternoon had been consumed in
discussing this really important business.</p>

<p>Perhaps Page was not so great a story-teller as many
Americans, but he excelled in a type of yarn that especially
delights Englishmen, for it is the kind that is native to the
American soil. He possessed an inexhaustible stock of
Negro anecdotes, and he had the gift of bringing them
out at precisely the right point. There was one which the
Archbishop of York never tired of repeating. Soon after
America entered the war, the Archbishop asked Page how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-307" id="page2-307"></a>[pg II-307]</span>
long his country was &quot;in for.&quot; &quot;I can best answer that
by telling you a story,&quot; said Page. &quot;There were two
Negroes who had just been sentenced to prison terms. As
they were being taken away in the carriage placed at their
disposal by the United States Government, one said to
the other, 'Sam, how long is you in fo'?' 'I guess dat it's
a yeah or two yeahs,' said Sam. 'How long is you in fo'?'
'I guess it's from now on,' said the other darky.&quot; &quot;From
now on,&quot; remarked the Archbishop, telling this story.
&quot;What could more eloquently have described America's
attitude toward the war?&quot;</p>

<p>The mention of the Archbishop suggests another of
Page's talents&mdash;the aptness of his letters of introduction.
In the spring of 1918 the Archbishop, at the
earnest recommendation of Page and Mr. Balfour, came
to the United States. Page prepared the way by letters
to several distinguished Americans, of which this one, to
Theodore Roosevelt, is a fair sample:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Theodore Roosevelt</i><br />
<br />
London, January 16, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. ROOSEVELT:</p>

<p>The Archbishop of York goes to the United States to
make some observations of us and of our ways and to
deliver addresses&mdash;on the invitation of some one of our
church organizations; a fortunate event for us and, I have
ventured to tell him, for him also.</p>

<p>During his brief stay in our country, I wish him to
make your acquaintance, and I have given him a card
of introduction to you, and thus I humbly serve you
both.</p>

<p>The Archbishop is a man and a brother, a humble,
learned, earnest, companionable fellow, with most charming
manners and an attractive personality, a good friend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-308" id="page2-308"></a>[pg II-308]</span>
mine, which argues much for him and (I think) implies also
something in my behalf. You will enjoy him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
I am, dear Mr. Roosevelt,<br />
<br />
Sincerely yours,<br />
<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>Greatly as Page loved England he never ceased to
preach his Americanism. That he preferred his own
country to any other and that he believed that it was its
greatest destiny to teach its institutions to the rest of the
world, Page's letters show; yet this was with him no cheap
spread-eagleism; it was a definite philosophy which the
Ambassador had completely thought out. He never
hesitated to express his democratic opinions in any company,
and only once or twice were there any signs that these
ideas jarred a little in certain strongholds of conservatism.
Even in the darkest period of American neutrality Page's
faith in the American people remained complete. After
this country had entered the war and the apparent slowness
of the Washington Administration had raised certain
questionings, Page never doubted that the people themselves,
however irresolute and lukewarm their representatives
might be, would force the issue to its only logical
end. Even so friendly a man as Mr. Balfour once voiced
a popular apprehension that the United States might
not get into the war with all its strength or might withdraw
prematurely. This was in the early period of our
participation. &quot;Who is going to stop the American
people and how?&quot; Page quickly replied. &quot;I think that
was a good answer,&quot; he said, as he looked back at the
episode in the summer of 1918, when hundreds of thousands
of Americans were landing in France every month.
A scrap of his writing records a discussion at a dinner
party on this question: &quot;If you could have a month in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-309" id="page2-309"></a>[pg II-309]</span>
time and any country, what time and what country would
you choose?&quot; The majority voted for England in the
time of Elizabeth, but Page's preference was for Athens
in the days of Pericles. Then came a far more interesting
debate: &quot;If you could spend a second lifetime when and
where would you choose to spend it?&quot; On this Page
had not a moment's hesitation: &quot;In the future and in the
U.S.A.!&quot; and he upheld his point with such persuasiveness
that he carried the whole gathering with him. His
love of anything suggesting America came out on all
occasions. One of his English hostesses once captivated
him by serving corn bread at a luncheon. &quot;The American
Ambassador and corn bread!&quot; he exclaimed with all
the delight of a schoolboy. Again he was invited, with
another distinguished American, to serve as godfather at
the christening of the daughter of an American woman
who had married an Englishman. When the ceremony
was finished he leaned over the font toward his fellow
godfather. &quot;Born on July 4th,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;of
an American mother! And we two Yankee godfathers!
We'll see that this child is taught the Constitution of the
United States!&quot;</p>

<p>One day an American duchess came into Page's office.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going home for a little visit and I want a passport,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't get a passport here,&quot; Page replied.
&quot;You must go to the Foreign Office.&quot;</p>

<p>His visitor was indignant.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; she answered. &quot;I am an American: you
know that I am; you knew my father. I want an American
passport.&quot;</p>

<p>Page patiently explained the citizenship and naturalization
laws and finally convinced his caller that she was now
a British subject and must have a British passport. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-310" id="page2-310"></a>[pg II-310]</span>
this American duchess left the room he shook at her a
menacing forefinger.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't tell me,&quot; was the Ambassador's parting shot,
&quot;that you thought that you could have your Duke and
Uncle Sam, too!&quot;</p>

<p>The judgments which Page passed on men and things
were quick and they were not infrequently wise. One of
these judgments had historic consequences the end of which
cannot even yet be foreseen. On the outbreak of hostilities,
as already related, an American Relief Committee
was organized in London to look out for the interests of
stranded Americans. Page kept a close eye on its operations,
and soon his attention was attracted by the noiseless
efficiency of an American engineer of whom he
had already caught a few fleeting glimpses in the period
of peace. After he had finished his work with the
American Committee, Mr. Herbert C. Hoover began to
make his arrangements to leave for the United States.
His private affairs had been disorganized; he had already
sent his family home, and his one ambition was
to get on the first ship sailing for the United States.
The idea of Belgian relief, or of feeding starving people
anywhere, had never occurred to him. At this moment
an American, Mr. Millard K. Shaler, came from Brussels
and gave the most harrowing account of conditions in
Belgium. Mr. Hoover took Mr. Shaler to Page, who
immediately became sympathetic. The Ambassador arranged
an interview between Mr. Hoover and Sir Edward
Grey, who likewise showed great interest and promised
government support. Soon afterward three Belgians
arrived and described the situation as immediately alarming:
Brussels had only food enough to feed the people for
thirty-six hours; after that, unless help were forthcoming,
the greatest distress would set in. Five men&mdash;Page, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-311" id="page2-311"></a>[pg II-311]</span>
three Belgians, and Mr. Hoover&mdash;at once got together at
the American Embassy. Upon the result of that meeting
hung the fate of millions of people. Who before had ever
undertaken a scheme for feeding an entire nation for an
indefinite period? That there were great obstacles in the
way all five men knew; the British Admiralty in particular
were strongly opposed; there was a fear that the food, if
it could be acquired and sent to Belgium, would find its
way to the German Army. Unless the British Government
could be persuaded that this could be prevented, the
enterprise would fail at the start. How could it be
done?</p>

<p>&quot;There is only one way,&quot; said Page. &quot;Some government
must give its guarantee that this food will get to the
Belgian people.&quot; &quot;And, of course,&quot; he added, &quot;there
is only one government that can do that. It must be the
American Government.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hoover pointed out that any such guarantee involved
the management of transportation; only by controlling
the railroads could the American Government
make sure that this food would reach its destination.</p>

<p>And that, added Page, involved a director&mdash;some one
man who could take charge of the whole enterprise. Who
should it be?</p>

<p>Then Page turned quickly to the young American.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoover, you're It!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hoover made no reply; he neither accepted nor
rejected the proposal. He merely glanced at the clock,
then got up and silently left the room. In a few
minutes he returned and entered again into the discussion.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoover, why did you get up and leave us so
abruptly?&quot; asked Page, a little puzzled over this behaviour.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-312" id="page2-312"></a>[pg II-312]</span></div>
<p>&quot;I saw by the clock,&quot; came the answer&mdash;and it was a
story that Page was fond of telling, as illustrating the
rapidity with which Mr. Hoover worked&mdash;&quot;that there
was an hour left before the Exchange closed in New York.
So I went out and cabled, buying several millions of
bushels of wheat&mdash;for the Belgians, of course.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For what is usually known as &quot;society&quot; Page had little
inclination. Yet for social intercourse on a more genuine
plane he had real gifts. Had he enjoyed better health,
week ends in the country would have afforded him welcome
entertainment. He also liked dinner parties but indulged
in them very moderately. He was a member of
many London clubs but he seldom visited any of them.
There were a number of organizations, however, which he
regularly attended. The Society of Dilettanti, a company
of distinguished men interested in promoting the arts and
improving the public taste, which has been continuously
in existence since 1736, enrolling in each generation the
greatest painters and writers of the time, elected Page
to membership. He greatly enjoyed its dinners in the
Banquet Hall of the Grafton Gallery. &quot;Last night,&quot; he
writes, describing his initial appearance, &quot;I attended my
first Dilettanti dinner and was inducted, much as a new
Peer is inducted into the House of Lords. Lord Mersey
in the chair&mdash;in a red robe. These gay old dogs have had
a fine time of it for nearly 200 years&mdash;good wine, high
food, fine satisfaction. The oldest dining society in the
Kingdom. The blue blood old Briton has the art of enjoying
himself reduced to a very fine point indeed.&quot; Another
gathering whose meetings he seldom missed was
that of the Kinsmen, an informal club of literary men
who met occasionally for food and converse in the Trocadero
Restaurant. Here Page would meet such congenial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-313" id="page2-313"></a>[pg II-313]</span>
souls as Sir James Barrie and Sir Arthur Pinero, all of
whom retain lively memories of Page at these gatherings.
&quot;He was one of the most lovable characters I have ever
had the good fortune to encounter,&quot; says Sir Arthur
Pinero, recalling these occasions. &quot;In what special
quality or qualities lay the secret of his charm and influence?
Surely in his simplicity and transparent honesty,
and in the possession of a disposition which, without
the smallest loss of dignity, was responsive and affectionate.
Distinguished American Ambassadors will come and
go, and will in their turn win esteem and admiration. But
none, I venture to say, will efface the recollection of Walter
Page from the minds of those who were privileged to
gain his friendship.&quot;</p>

<p>One aspect of Page that remains fixed in the memory of
his associates is his unwearied industry with the pen.
His official communications and his ordinary correspondence
Page dictated; but his personal letters he wrote
with his own hand. He himself deplored the stenographer
as a deterrent to good writing; the habit of dictating,
he argued, led to wordiness and general looseness of
thought. Practically all the letters published in these
volumes were therefore the painstaking work of Page's
own pen. His handwriting was so beautiful and clear
that, in his editorial days, the printers much preferred it
as &quot;copy&quot; to typewritten matter. This habit is especially
surprising in view of the Ambassador's enormous epistolary
output. It must be remembered that the letters
included in the present book are only a selection from
the vast number that he wrote during his five years in
England; many of these letters fill twenty and thirty
pages of script; the labour involved in turning them out;
day after day, seems fairly astounding. Yet with Page
this was a labour of love. All through his Ambassadorship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-314" id="page2-314"></a>[pg II-314]</span>
he seemed hardly contented unless he had a pen in
his hand. As his secretaries would glance into his room,
there they would see the Ambassador bending over his
desk-writing, writing, eternally writing; sometimes he
would call them in, and read what he had written, never
hesitating to tear up the paper if their unfavourable
criticisms seemed to him well taken. The Ambassador
kept a desk also in his bedroom, and here his most important
correspondence was attended to. Page's all-night
self-communings before his wood fire have already
been described, and he had another nocturnal occupation
that was similarly absorbing. Many a night, after returning
late from his office or from dinner, he would put
on his dressing gown, sit at his bedroom desk, and start
pouring forth his inmost thoughts in letters to the President,
Colonel House, or some other correspondent. His pen
flew over the paper with the utmost rapidity and the
Ambassador would sometimes keep at his writing until
two or three o'clock in the morning. There is a frequently
expressed fear that letter writing is an art of the
past; that the intervention of the stenographer has destroyed
its spontaneity; yet it is evident that in Page
the present generation has a letter writer of the old-fashioned
kind, for he did all his writing with his own hand
and under circumstances that would assure the utmost
freshness and vividness to the result.</p>

<p>An occasional game of golf, which he played badly,
a trip now and then to rural England&mdash;these were
Page's only relaxations from his duties. Though he was
not especially fond of leaving his own house, he was always
delighted when visitors came to him. And the
American Embassy, during the five years from 1913 to
1918, extended a hospitality which was fittingly democratic
in its quality but which gradually drew within its doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-315" id="page2-315"></a>[pg II-315]</span>
all that was finest in the intellect and character of
England. Page himself attributed the popularity of his
house to his wife. Mrs. Page certainly embodied the
traits most desirable in the Ambassadress of a great
Republic. A woman of cultivation, a tireless reader,
a close observer of people and events and a shrewd
commentator upon them, she also had an unobtrusive
dignity, a penetrating sympathy, and a capacity for
human association, which, while more restrained and
more placid than that of her husband, made her a helpful
companion for a sorely burdened man. The American
Embassy under Mr. and Mrs. Page was not one of London's
smart houses as that word is commonly understood
in this great capital. But No. 6 Grosvenor Square,
in the spaciousness of its rooms, the simple beauty of its
furnishings, and especially in its complete absence of
ostentation, made it the worthy abiding place of an American
Ambassador. And the people who congregated there
were precisely the kind that appeal to the educated American.
&quot;I didn't know I was getting into an assembly
of immortals,&quot; exclaimed Mr. Hugh Wallace, when he
dropped in one Thursday afternoon for tea, and found
himself foregathered with Sir Edward Grey, Henry James,
John Sargent, and other men of the same type. It was
this kind of person who most naturally gravitated to the
Page establishment, not the ultra-fashionable, the merely
rich, or the many titled. The formal functions which the
position demanded the Pages scrupulously gave; but the
affairs which Page most enjoyed and which have left
the most lasting remembrances upon his guests were the informal
meetings with his chosen favourites, for the most
part literary men. Here Page's sheer brilliancy of conversation
showed at its best. Lord Bryce, Sir John Simon,
John Morley, the inevitable companions, Henry James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-316" id="page2-316"></a>[pg II-316]</span>
and John Sargent&mdash;&quot;What things have I seen done at
the Mermaid&quot;; and certainly these gatherings of wits and
savants furnished as near an approach to its Elizabethan
prototype as London could then present.</p>

<p>Besides his official activities Page performed great services
to the two countries by his speeches. The demands
of this kind on an American Ambassador are always numerous,
but Page's position was an exceptional one; it was
his fortune to represent America at a time when his own
country and Great Britain were allies in a great war. He
could therefore have spent practically all his time in speaking
had he been so disposed. Of the hundreds of invitations
received he was able to accept only a few, but most
of these occasions became memorable ones. In any spectacular
sense Page was not an orator; he rather despised
the grand manner, with its flourishes and its tricks; the
name of public speaker probably best describes his talents
on the platform. Here his style was earnest and conversational:
his speech flowed with the utmost readiness;
it was invariably quiet and restrained; he was never aiming
at big effects, but his words always went home. Of the
series of speeches that stand to his credit in England probably
the one that will be longest remembered is that
delivered at Plymouth on August 4, 1917, the third anniversary
of the war. This not only reviewed the common
history of the two nations for three hundred years,
and suggested a programme for making the bonds tighter
yet, but it brought the British public practical assurances
as to America's intentions in the conflict. Up to
that time there had been much vagueness and doubt; no
official voice had spoken the clear word for the United
States; the British public did not know what to expect
from their kinsmen overseas. But after Page's Plymouth
speech the people of Great Britain looked forward with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-317" id="page2-317"></a>[pg II-317]</span>
complete confidence to the co&ouml;peration of the two countries
and to the inevitable triumph of this co&ouml;peration.</p>

<i>To Arthur W. Page</i><br />
<br />
Knebworth House, Knebworth,<br />
August 11, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Arthur:</p>

<p>First of all, these three years have made me tired. I
suppose there's no doubt about that, if there were any
scientific way of measuring it. While of course the strain
now is nothing like what it was during the days of neutrality,
there's yet some strain.</p>

<p>I went down to Plymouth to make a speech on the anniversary
of the beginning of the war&mdash;went to tell them
in the west of England something about relations with
the United States and something about what the United
States is doing in the war. It turned out to be a great
success. The Mayor met me at the train; there was a
military company, the Star Spangled Banner and real
American applause. All the way through the town the
streets were lined with all the inhabitants and more&mdash;apparently
millions of 'em. They made the most of it for
five solid days.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 4th the Mayor gave me an
official luncheon. Thence we went to the esplanade facing
the sea, where soldiers and sailors were lined up for
half a mile. The American Flag was flung loose, the Star
Spangled Banner broke forth from the band, and all the
people in that part of the world were there gathered to see
the show. After all this salute the Mayor took me to the
stand and he and I made speeches, and the background
was a group of dozens of admirals and generals and many
smaller fry. Then I reviewed the troops; then they
marched by me and in an hour or two the show was over.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-318" id="page2-318"></a>[pg II-318]</span>
<p>Then the bowling club&mdash;the same club and the same
green as when Drake left the game to sail out to meet the
Armada.</p>

<p>Then a solemn service in the big church, where the
prayers were written and the hymns selected with reference
to our part in the war.</p>

<p>Then, of course, a dinner party. At eight o'clock at
night, the Guildhall, an enormous town hall, was packed
with people and I made my speech at 'em. A copy (somewhat
less good than the version I gave them) goes to you,
along with a leader from the <i>Times</i>. They were vociferously
grateful for any assuring word about the United
States. It's strange how very little the provincial Englander
knows about what we have done and mean to do.
They took the speech finely, and I have had good letters
about it from all sorts of people in every part of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Then followed five days of luncheons and dinners and
garden parties&mdash;and (what I set out to say) I got back to
London last night dead tired. To-day your mother and
I came here&mdash;about twenty-five miles from London&mdash;for
a fortnight.</p>

<p>This is Bulwer-Lytton's house&mdash;a fine old English place
hired this year by Lady Strafford, whom your mother is
visiting for a fortnight or more, and they let me come
along, too. They have given me the big library, as good
a room as I want&mdash;with as bad pens as they can find in
the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Your mother is tired, too. Since the American Red
Cross was organized here, she has added to her committee
and hospitals. But she keeps well and very vigorous. A
fortnight here will set her up. She enjoyed Plymouth
very much in spite of the continual rush, and it was a rush.</p>

<p>What the United States is doing looks good and large at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-319" id="page2-319"></a>[pg II-319]</span>
this distance. The gratitude here is unbounded; but I
detect a feeling here and there of wonder whether we are
going to keep up this activity to the end.</p>

<p>I sometimes feel that the German collapse <i>may</i> come
next winter. Their internal troubles and the lack of
sufficient food and raw materials do increase. The breaking
point may be reached before another summer. I
wish I could prove it or even certainly predict it. But it is
at least conceivable. Alas, no one can <i>prove</i> anything
about the war. The conditions have no precedents.
The sum of human misery and suffering is simply incalculable,
as is the loss of life; and the gradual and general
brutalization goes on and on and on far past any preceding
horrors.</p>

<p>With all my love to you and Mollie and the trio,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<p>And so for five busy and devastating years Page did his
work. The stupidities of Washington might drive him
to desperation, ill-health might increase his periods of
despondency, the misunderstandings that he occasionally
had with the British Government might add to his discouragements,
but a naturally optimistic and humorous
temperament overcame all obstacles, and did its part in
bringing about that united effort which ended in victory.
And that it was a great part, the story of his Ambassadorship
abundantly proves. Page was not the soldier working
in the blood and slime of Flanders, nor the sea fighter
spending day and night around the foggy coast of Ireland,
nor the statesman bending parliaments to his will and
manipulating nations and peoples in the mighty game
whose stake was civilization itself. But history will indeed
be ungrateful if it ever forgot the gaunt and pensive
figure, clad in a dressing gown, sitting long into the morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-320" id="page2-320"></a>[pg II-320]</span>
before the smouldering fire at 6 Grosvenor Square,
seeking to find some way to persuade a reluctant and hesitating
President to lead his country in the defense of
liberty and determined that, so far as he could accomplish
it, the nation should play a part in the great assize
that was in keeping with its traditions and its instincts.</p>

Sunday, September,[sic] 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear House:</p>

<p>... By far the most important peace plan or utterance
is the President's extraordinary answer to the Pope<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64" /><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.
His flat and convincing refusal to take the word of the present
rulers of Germany as of any value has had more effect
here than any other utterance and it is, so far, the best
contribution we have made to the war. The best evidence
that I can get shows also that it has had more effect in
Germany than anything else that has been said by anybody.
That hit the bull's-eye with perfect accuracy; and
it has been accepted here as <i>the</i> war aim and <i>the</i> war
condition. So far as I can make out it is working in Germany
toward peace with more effect than any other deliverance
made by anybody. And it steadied the already unshakable
resolution here amazingly.</p>

<p>I can get any information here of course without danger
of the slightest publicity&mdash;an important point, because
even the mention of peace now is dangerous. All the
world, under this long strain, is more or less off the normal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-322" id="page2-322"></a>[pg II-322]</span>
and all my work&mdash;even routine work&mdash;is done with the
profoundest secrecy: it has to be.</p>

<p>Our energetic war preparations call forth universal admiration
and gratitude here on all sides and nerve up the
British and hearten them more than I know how to explain.
There is an eager and even pathetic curiosity to
hear all the details, to hear, in fact, anything about the
United States; and what the British do not know about the
United States would fill the British Museum. They do
know, however, that they would soon have been obliged
to make an unsatisfactory peace if we hadn't come in when
we did and they freely say so. The little feeling of jealousy
that we should come in and win the war at the end
has, I think, been forgotten, swallowed up in their genuine
gratitude.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>... The President has sent Admiral Mayo over to
study the naval situation. So far as I can learn the feeling
at Washington is that the British Navy has done
nothing. Why, it hasn't attacked the German naval bases
and destroyed the German navy and ended the war!
Why not? I have a feeling that Mayo will supplement
and support Sims in his report. Then gradually the naval
men at Washington may begin to understand and they
may get the important facts into the President's head.
Meantime the submarine work of the Germans continues
to win the war, although the government and the people
here and in the United States appear not to believe it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-323" id="page2-323"></a>[pg II-323]</span>
They are still destroying seventy-five British ships a
month besides an additional (smaller) number of allied
and neutral ships. And all the world together is not
turning out seventy-five ships a month; nor are we all
destroying submarines as fast as the Germans are turning
<i>them</i> out. Yet all the politicians are putting on a cheerful
countenance about it because the Germans are not
starving England out and are not just now sinking passenger
ships. They may begin this again at any time. They
have come within a few feet of torpedoing two of our
American liners. The submarine <i>is</i> the war yet, but nobody
seems disposed to believe it. They'll probably wake
up with a great shock some day&mdash;or the war may possibly
end before the destruction of ships becomes positively
fatal.</p>

<p>The President's letter to the Pope gives him the moral
and actual leadership now. The Hohenzollerns must go.
Somehow the subjects and governments of these Old
World kingdoms have not hitherto laid emphasis on this.
There's still a divinity that doth hedge a king in most
European minds. To me this is the very queerest thing
in the whole world. What again if Germany, Austria,
Spain should follow Russia? Whether they do or not
crowns will not henceforth be so popular. There is an
unbounded enthusiasm here for the President's letter and
for the President in general.</p>

<p>In spite of certain details which it seems impossible to
make understood on the Potomac, the whole American
preparation and enthusiasm seem from this distance to
be very fine. The <i>people</i> seem in earnest. When I read
about tax bills, about the food regulation and a thousand
other such things, I am greatly gratified. And it proves
that we were right when we said that during the days
of neutrality the people were held back. It all looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-324" id="page2-324"></a>[pg II-324]</span>
exceedingly good from this distance, and it makes me
homesick.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR EFFENDI:</p>

<p>... The enormous war work and war help that
everybody seems to be doing in the United States is
heartily appreciated here&mdash;most heartily. The English
eat out of our hands. You can see American uniforms
every day in London. Every ship brings them. Everybody's
thrilled to see them. The Americans here have
great houses opened as officers' clubs, and scrumptious
huts for men where countesses and other high ladies hand
out sandwiches and serve ice cream and ginger beer.
Our two admirals are most popular with all classes, from
royalty down. English soldiers salute our officers in the
street and old gentlemen take off their hats when they
meet nurses with the American Red Cross uniform. My
Embassy now occupies four buildings for offices, more
than half of them military and naval. And my own staff,
proper, is the biggest in the world and keeps growing.
When I go, in a little while, to receive the Freedom of the
City of Edinburgh, I shall carry an Admiral or a General
as my aide!</p>

<p>That's the way we keep a stiff upper lip.</p>

<p>And Good Lord! it's tiresome. Peace? We'd all give
our lives for the right sort of peace, and never move an
eyelid. But only the wrong sort has yet come within
reach. The other sort is coming, however; for these present
German contortions are the beginning of the end.
But the weariness of it, and the tragedy and the cost.
No human creature was ever as tired as I am. Yet I keep
well and keep going and keep working all my waking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-325" id="page2-325"></a>[pg II-325]</span>
hours. When it ends, I shall collapse and go home and
have to rest a while. So at least I feel now. And, if I
outlive the work and the danger and the weariness, I'll
praise God for that. And it doesn't let up a single day.
And I'm no worse off than everybody else.</p>

<p>So this over-weary world goes, dear Effendi; but the
longest day shades at last down to twilight and rest; and
so this will be. And poor old Europe will then not be
worth while for the rest of our lives&mdash;a vast grave and
ruin where unmated women will mourn and starvation
will remain for years to come.</p>

<p>God bless us.</p></div>

London, November 9, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR EFFENDI:</p>

<p>... This infernal thing drags its slow length along
so that we cannot see even a day ahead, not to say a week,
or a year. If any man here allowed the horrors of it to
dwell on his mind he would go mad, so we have to skip
over these things somewhat lightly and try to keep the
long, definite aim in our thoughts and to work away distracted
as little as possible by the butchery and by the
starvation that is making this side of the world a shambles
and a wilderness. There is hardly a country on the Continent
where people are not literally starving to death,
and in many of them by hundreds of thousands; and this
state of things is going to continue for a good many years
after the war. God knows we (I mean the American
people) are doing everything we can to alleviate it but
there is so much more to be done than any group of forces
can possibly do, that I have a feeling that we have hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-326" id="page2-326"></a>[pg II-326]</span>
touched the borders of the great problem itself. Of course
here in London we are away from all that. In spite of the
rations we get quite enough to eat and it's as good as it is
usually in England, but we have no right to complain. Of
course we are subject to air raids, and the wise air people
here think that early next spring we are going to be bombarded
with thousands of aeroplanes, and with new kinds
of bombs and gases in a well-organized effort to try actually
to destroy London. Possibly that will come; we must
simply take our chance, every man sticking to his job.
Already the slate shingles on my roof have been broken,
and bricks have been knocked down my chimney; the sky-light
was hit and glass fell down all through the halls, and
the nose of a shrapnel shell, weighing eight pounds, fell just
in front of my doorway and rolled in my area. This is the
sort of thing we incidentally get, not of course from the
enemy directly, but from the British guns in London which
shoot these things at German aeroplanes. What goes up
must come down. Between our own defences and the
enemy, God knows which will kill us first!</p>

<p>In spite of all this I put my innocent head on my pillow
every night and get a good night's sleep after the bombing
is done, and I thank Heaven that nothing interrupts my
sleep. This, and a little walking, which is all I get time to
do in these foggy days, constitute my life outdoors and
precious little of it is outdoors.</p>

<p>Then on every block that I know of in London there is
a hospital or supply place and the ambulances are bringing
the poor fellows in all the time. We don't get any gasolene
to ride so we have to walk. We don't get any white
bread so we have to eat stuff made of flour and corn meal
ground so fine that it isn't good. While everybody gets
a little thinner, the universal opinion is that they also get
a little better, and nobody is going to die here of hunger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-327" id="page2-327"></a>[pg II-327]</span>
We feel a little more cheerful about the submarines than
we did some time ago. For some reason they are not getting
so many ships. One reason, I am glad to believe, is
that they are getting caught themselves. If I could remember
all the stories that I hear of good fighting with
the submarines I could keep you up two nights when I get
home, but in these days one big thing after another crowds
so in men's minds that the Lord knows if, when I get
home, I shall remember anything.</p></div>

London, December 3, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>... Some of the British military men in London
are not hopeful of an early end of the war nor even cheerful
about the result. They are afraid of the war-weariness
that overcame Russia and gave Italy a setback. They
say the military task, though long and slow and hard,
can be done if everybody will pull together and keep at
the job without weariness&mdash;<i>be done by our help</i>. But they
have fits of fear of France. They are discouraged by the
greater part of Lord Lansdowne's letter<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65" /><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. I myself do not
set great value on this military feeling in London, for the
British generals in France do not share it. Lord French
once said to me and General Robertson, too, that when
they feel despondent in London, they go to the front and
get cheered up. But it does seem to be a long job.
Evidently the Germans mean to fight to the last man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-328" id="page2-328"></a>[pg II-328]</span>
unless they can succeed in inducing the Allies to meet them
to talk it over without naming their terms in advance.
That is what Lord Lansdowne favours, and no public outgiving
by any prominent man in England has called forth
such a storm of protest since the war began. I think I
see the genesis of his thought, and it is this: there is
nothing in his letter and there was nothing in the half dozen
or more rather long conversations that I have had with
him on other subjects to show that he has the slightest
conception of democracy as a social creed or as a political
system. He is, I think, the most complete aristocrat
that I have ever met. He doesn't see the war at all as a
struggle between democracy and its opposite. He sees it
merely as a struggle between Germany and the Allies;
and inferentially he is perfectly willing the Kaiser should
remain in power. He is of course a patriotic man and a
man of great cultivation. But he doesn't see the deeper
meaning of the conflict. Add to this defect of understanding,
a long period of bad health and a lasting depression
because of the loss of his son, and his call to the
war-weary ceases to be a surprise.</p></div>

American Embassy,<br />
London, December 23, 1917.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>I sent you a Christmas cable yesterday for everybody.
That's about all I can send in these days of slow mail and
restricted shipping and enormously high prices; and you
gave all the girls each $100 for me, for the babies and
themselves? That'll show 'em that at least we haven't forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-329" id="page2-329"></a>[pg II-329]</span>
them. Forgotten? Your mother and I are always
talking of the glad day when we can go home and live
among them. We get as homesick as small boys their
first month at a boarding school. Do you remember the
day I left you at Lawrenceville, a forlorn and lonely kid?&mdash;It's
like that.</p>

<p>A wave of depression hangs over the land like a London
fog. And everybody on this tired-out side of the
world shows a disposition to lean too heavily on us&mdash;to
depend on us so completely that the fear arises that they
may unconsciously relax their own utmost efforts when we
begin to fight. Yet they can't in the least afford to relax,
and, when the time comes, I dare say they will not. Yet
the plain truth is, the French may give out next year for
lack of men. I do not mean that they will quit, but that
their fighting strength will have passed its maximum and
that they will be able to play only a sort of second part.
Except the British and the French, there's no nation in
Europe worth a tinker's damn when you come to the real
scratch. The whole continent is rotten or tyrannical or
yellow-dog. I wouldn't give Long Island or Moore
County for the whole of continental Europe, with its
kings and itching palms.</p>

<p>... Waves of depression and of hope&mdash;if not of
elation&mdash;come and go. I am told, and I think truly, that
waves of weariness come in London far oftener and more
depressingly than anywhere else in the Kingdom. There
is no sign nor fear that the British will give up; they'll
hold on till the end. Winston Churchill said to me last
night: &quot;We can hold on till next year. But after 1918, it'll
be your fight. We'll have to depend on you.&quot; I told
him that such a remark might well be accepted in some
quarters as a British surrender. Then he came up to the
scratch: &quot;Surrender? Never.&quot; But I fear we need&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-330" id="page2-330"></a>[pg II-330]</span>
some practical and non-ostentatious way&mdash;now and then
to remind all these European folk that we get no particular
encouragement by being unduly leaned on.</p>

<p>It is, however, the weariest Christmas in all British
annals, certainly since the Napoleonic wars. The untoward
event after the British advance toward Cambrai
caused the retirement of six British generals and deepened
the depression here. Still I can see it now passing. Even
a little victory will bring back a wave of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Depression or elation show equally the undue strain
that British nerves are under. I dare say nobody is entirely
normal. News of many sorts can now be circulated
only by word of mouth. The queerest stories are
whispered about and find at least temporary credence.
For instance: The report has been going around that the
revolution that took place in Portugal the other day was
caused by the Germans (likely enough); that it was a
monarchical movement and that the Germans were going
to put the King back on the throne as soon as the war
ended. Sensation-mongers appear at every old-woman's
knitting circle. And all this has an effect on conduct.
Two young wives of noble officers now in France have just
run away with two other young noblemen&mdash;to the scandal
of a large part of good society in London. It is universally
said that the morals of more hitherto good people are
wrecked by the strain put upon women by the absence of
their husbands than was ever before heard of. Everybody
is overworked. Fewer people are literally truthful
than ever before. Men and women break down and fall
out of working ranks continuously. The number of men
in the government who have disappeared from public
view is amazing, the number that would like to disappear
is still greater&mdash;from sheer overstrain. The Prime Minister
is tired. Bonar Law in a long conference that Crosby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-331" id="page2-331"></a>[pg II-331]</span>
and I had with him yesterday wearily ran all round a circle
rather than hit a plain proposition with a clear decision.
Mr. Balfour has kept his house from overwork a few days
every recent week. I lunched with Mr. Asquith yesterday;
even he seemed jaded; and Mrs. Asquith assured me that
&quot;everything is going to the devil damned fast.&quot; Some conspicuous
men who have always been sober have taken to
drink. The very few public dinners that are held are
served with ostentatious meagreness to escape criticism.
I attended one last week at which there was no bread, no
butter, no sugar served. All of which doesn't mean that
the world here is going to the bad&mdash;only that it moves backward
and forward by emotions; and this is normally a most
unemotional race. Overwork and the loss of Sons and
friends&mdash;the list of the lost grows&mdash;always make an abnormal
strain. The churches are fuller than ever before.
So, too, are the &quot;parlours&quot; of the fortune-tellers. So
also the theatres&mdash;in the effort to forget one's self. There
are afternoon dances for young officers at home on leave:
the curtains are drawn and the music is muffled. More
marriages take place&mdash;blind and maimed, as well as the
young fellows just going to France&mdash;than were ever celebrated
in any year within men's memory. Verse-writing
is rampant. I have received enough odes and sonnets
celebrating the Great Republic and the Great President
to fill a folio volume. Several American Y.M.C.A.
workers lately turned rampant Pacifists and had to be
sent home. Colonial soldiers and now and then an
American sailor turn up at our Y.M.C.A. huts as full as
a goat and swear after the event that they never did such
a thing before. Emotions and strain everywhere!</p></div>

<p>In March Page, a very weary man&mdash;as these letters
indicate&mdash;took a brief holiday at St. Ives, on the coast of
Cornwall. As he gazed out on the Atlantic, the yearning
for home, for the sandhills and the pine trees of North
Carolina, again took possession of his soul. Yet it is evident,
from a miscellaneous group of letters written at this
time, that his mind revelled in a variety of subjects, ranging
all the way from British food and vegetables to the
settlement of the war and from secret diplomacy to literary
style.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Mrs. Charles G. Loring</i><br />
St. Ives, Cornwall, March 3, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR KITTY:</p>

<p>Your mother of course needed a rest away from London
after the influenza got done with her; and I discovered that
I had gone stale. So she and I and the golf clubs came
here yesterday&mdash;as near to the sunlit land of Uncle Sam
as you can well get on this island. We look across the
ocean&mdash;at least out into it&mdash;in your direction, but I must
confess that Labrador is not in sight. The place is all
right, the hotel uncommonly good, but it's Greenlandish
in its temperature&mdash;a very cold wind blowing. The golf
clubs lean up against the wall and curse the weather. But
we are away from the hordes of people and will have a
little quiet here. It's as quiet as any far-off place by the
sea, and it's clean. London is the dirtiest town in the
world.</p>

<p>By the way that picture of Chud came (by Col.
Honey) along with Alice Page's adorable little photograph.
As for the wee chick, I see how you are already beginning
to get a lot of fun with her. And you'll have more and
more as she gets bigger. Give her my love and see what
she'll say. You won't get so lonesome, dear Kitty, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-333" id="page2-333"></a>[pg II-333]</span>
little Alice; and I can't keep from thinking as well as hoping
that the war will not go on as long as it sometimes
seems that it must. The utter collapse of Russia has
given Germany a vast victory on that side and it may turn
out that this will make an earlier peace possible than would
otherwise have come. And the Germans may be&mdash;in
fact, <i>must</i> be, very short of some of the essentials of war
in their metals or in cotton. They are in a worse internal
plight than has been made known, I am sure. I can't keep
from hoping that peace may come this year. Of course,
my guess may be wrong; but everything I hear points in
the direction of my timid prediction.</p></div>

<p>Now get a bang-up gardener no matter what he costs.
Get him started. Put it up to him to start toward the
foregoing programme, to be reached in (say) three years&mdash;two
if possible. He must learn to grow these things
absolutely better than they are now grown anywhere on
earth. He must get the best seed. He must get muck
out of the swamp, manure from somewhere, etc. etc. He
must have the supreme flavour in each thing. Let him
take room enough for each&mdash;plenty of room. He doesn't

in all Europe. And you'll recall that we jarred 'em and
had good things all winter.</p>

Tin mines are all about here. Tin and golf are
good crops in their way, but they don't feed the belly of
man. As matters stand the only people that have fit
things to eat now in all Europe are the American troops in
France, and their food comes out of tins chiefly. Ach!

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>Your letter, written from the University Club, is just
come. It makes a very distinct impression on my mind
which my own conclusions and fears have long confirmed.
Let me put it at its worst and in very bald terms: The
Great White Chief is at bottom pacifist, has always been
so and is so now. Of course I do not mean a pacifist at
any price, certainly not a cowardly pacifist. But (looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-337" id="page2-337"></a>[pg II-337]</span>
at theoretically) war is, of course, an absurd way of settling
any quarrel, an irrational way. Men and nations are
wasteful, cruel, pigheaded fools to indulge in it. Quite
true. But war is also the only means of adding to a
nation's territory the territory of other nations which they
do not wish to sell or to give up&mdash;the robbers' only way to
get more space or to get booty. This last explains this
war. Every Hohenzollern (except the present Emperor's
father, who reigned only a few months) since Frederick
the Great has added to Prussian and German area of rule.
Every one, therefore, as he comes to the throne, feels an
obligation to make his addition to the Empire. For this
the wars of Prussia with Austria, with Denmark, with
France were brought on. They succeeded and won the
additions that old William I made to the Empire. Now
William II must make <i>his</i> addition. He prepared for more
than forty years; the nation prepared before he came to
the throne and his whole reign has been given to making
sure that he was ready. It's a robber's raid. Of course,
the German case has been put so as to direct attention
from this bald fact.</p>

<p>Now the philosophical pacifists&mdash;I don't mean the cowardly,
yellow-dog ones&mdash;have never quite seen the war
in this aspect. They regard it as a dispute about something&mdash;about
trade, about more seaboard, about this or
that, whereas it is only a robber's adventure. They want
other people's property. They want money, treasure,
land, indemnities, minerals, raw materials; and they set
out to take them.</p>

<p>Now confusing this character of the war with some sort
of rational dispute about something, the pacifists try in
every way to stop it, so that the &quot;issue&quot; may be reasoned
out, debated, discussed, negotiated. Surely the President
tried to reach peace&mdash;tried as hard and as long as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-338" id="page2-338"></a>[pg II-338]</span>
people would allow him. The Germans argued away
time with him while they got their submarine fleet built.
Then they carried out the programme they had always
had in mind and had never thought of abandoning. Now
they wish to gain more time, to slacken the efforts of the
Allies, if possible to separate them by asking for
&quot;discussions&quot;&mdash;peace by &quot;negotiation.&quot; When you are about
to kill the robber, he cries out, &quot;For God's sake,
let's discuss the question between us. We can come to
terms.&quot;&mdash;Now here's where the danger comes from the
philosophical pacifist&mdash;from any man who does not clearly
understand the nature of the war and of the enemy. To
discuss the difference between us is so very reasonable in
sound&mdash;so very reasonable in fact if there were a discussable
difference. It is a programme that would always be
in order except with a burglar or a robber.</p>

<p>The yet imperfect understanding of the war and of the
nature of the German in the United States, especially at
Washington&mdash;more especially in the White House&mdash;herein
lies the danger.</p>

<p>... This little rest down here is a success. The
weather is a disappointment&mdash;windy and cold. But to
be away from London and away from folks&mdash;that's much.
Shoecraft is very good<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66" /><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. He sends us next to nothing.
Almost all we've got is an invitation to lunch with Their
Majesties and they've been good enough to put that off.
It's a far-off country, very fine, I'm sure in summer, and
with most beautiful golf links. The hill is now so windy
that no sane man can play there.</p>

<p>We're enjoying the mere quiet. And your mother is

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR KITTY:</p>

<p>A week here. No news. Shoecraft says we've missed
nothing in London. What we came for we've got: your
mother's quite well. She climbs these high hills quite
spryly. We've had a remarkable week in this respect&mdash;we
haven't carried on a conversation with any human being
but ourselves. I don't think any such thing has ever
happened before. I can stand a week, perhaps a fortnight
of this now. But I don't care for it for any long period.
At the bottom of this high and steep hill is the quaintest
little town I ever saw. There are some streets so narrow
that when a donkey cart comes along the urchins all have
to run to the next corner or into doors. There is no sidewalk,
of course; and the donkey cart takes the whole
room between the houses. Artists take to the town, and
they have funny little studios down by the water front in
tiny houses built of stone in pieces big enough to construct
a tidewater front. Imagine stone walls made of stone,
each weighing tons, built into little houses about as big as
your little back garden! There's one fellow here (an
artist) whom I used to know in New York, so small has
the world become!</p>

<p>On another hill behind us is a triangular stone monument
to John Knill. He was once mayor of the town.
When he died in 1782, he left money to the town. If the
town is to keep the money (as it has) the Mayor must once
in every five years form a procession and march up to this
monument. There ten girls, natives of the town, and
two widows must dance around the monument to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-340" id="page2-340"></a>[pg II-340]</span>
playing of a fiddle and a drum, the girls dressed in white.
This ceremony has gone on, once in five years, all this
time and the town has old Knill's money!</p>

<p>Your mother and I&mdash;though we are neither girls nor
widows&mdash;danced around it this morning, wondering what
sort of curmudgeon old John Knill was.</p>

<p>Don't you see how easily we fall into an idle mood?
Well, here's a photograph of little Alice looking up at
me from the table where I write&mdash;a good, sweet face she
has.</p>

<p>And you'll never get another letter from me in a time
and from a place whereof there is so little to tell.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR RALPH:</p>

<p>Arthur has sent me Gardiner's 37-page sketch of
American-British Concords and Discords&mdash;a remarkable
sketch; and he has reminded me that your summer plan
is to elaborate (into a popular style) your sketch of the
same subject. You and Gardiner went over the same
ground, each in a very good fashion. That's a fascinating
task, and it opens up a wholly new vista of our History
and of Anglo-Saxon, democratic history. Much lies
ahead of that. And all this puts it in my mind to write
you a little discourse on <i>style</i>. Gardiner has no style.
He put his facts down much as he would have noted on a
blue print the facts about an engineering project that he
sketched. The style of your article, which has much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-341" id="page2-341"></a>[pg II-341]</span>
be said for it as a magazine article, is not the best style
for a book.</p>

<p>Now, this whole question of style&mdash;well, it's the gist
of good writing. There's no really effective writing without
it. Especially is this true of historical writing. Look
at X Y Z's writings. He knows his American history
and has written much on it. He's written it as an Ohio
blacksmith shoes a horse&mdash;not a touch of literary value
in it all; all dry as dust&mdash;as dry as old Bancroft.</p>

<p>Style is good breeding&mdash;and art&mdash;in writing. It consists
of the arrangement of your matter, first; then, more,
of the gait; the manner and the manners of your expressing
it. Work every group of facts, naturally and logically
grouped to begin with, into a climax. Work every group
up as a sculptor works out his idea or a painter, each
group complete in itself. Throw out any superfluous
facts or any merely minor facts that prevent the orderly
working up of the group&mdash;that prevent or mar the effect
you wish to present.</p>

<p>Then, when you've got a group thus presented, go over
what you've made of it, to make sure you've used your
material and its arrangement to the best effect, taking
away merely extraneous or superfluous or distracting facts,
here and there adding concrete illustrations&mdash;putting in
a convincing detail here, and there a touch of colour.</p>

<p>Then go over it for your vocabulary. See that you use
no word in a different meaning than it was used 100 years
ago and will be used 100 years hence. You wish to use
only the permanent words&mdash;words, too, that will be understood
to carry the same meaning to English readers in
every part of the world. Your vocabulary must be chosen
from the permanent, solid, stable parts of the language.</p>

<p>Then see that no sentence contains a hint of obscurity.</p>

<p>Then go over the words you use to see if they be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-342" id="page2-342"></a>[pg II-342]</span>
best. Don't fall into merely current phrases. If you
have a long word, see if a native short one can be put in
its place which will be more natural and stronger. Avoid
a Latin vocabulary and use a plain English one&mdash;short
words instead of long ones.</p>

<p>Most of all, use <i>idioms</i>&mdash;English idioms of force. Say
an agreement was &quot;come to.&quot; Don't say it was &quot;consummated.&quot;
For the difference between idioms and a
Latin style, compare Lincoln with George Washington.
One's always interesting and convincing. The other is
dull in spite of all his good sense. How most folk do
misuse and waste words!</p>

<p>Freeman went too far in his use of one-syllable words.
It became an affectation. But he is the only man I can
think of that ever did go too far in that direction. X&mdash;would
have written a great history if he had had the
natural use of idioms. As it is, he has good sense and no
style; and his book isn't half so interesting as it would
have been if he had some style&mdash;some proper value of
short, clear-cut words that mean only one thing and that
leave no vagueness.</p>

<p>You'll get a good style if you practice it. It is in your
blood and temperament and way of saying things. But
it's a high art and must be laboriously cultivated.</p></div>

<p>This glimpse of a changing and chastened England
appears in a letter of this period:</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The disposition shown by an endless number of such
incidents is something more than a disposition of gratitude
of a people helped when they are hard pressed. All these
things show the changed and changing Englishman. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-343" id="page2-343"></a>[pg II-343]</span>
has already come to him that he may be weaker than he
had thought himself and that he may need friends more
than he had once imagined; and, if he must have helpers
and friends, he'd rather have his own kinsmen. He's a
queer &quot;cuss,&quot; this Englishman. But he isn't a liar nor
a coward nor any sort of &quot;a yellow dog.&quot; He's true, and
he never runs&mdash;a possible hero any day, and, when heroic,
modest and quiet and graceful. The trouble with him
has been that he got great world power too easily. In the
times when he exploited the world for his own enrichment,
there were no other successful exploiters. It became an
easy game to him. He organized sea traffic and sea
power. Of course he became rich&mdash;far, far richer than
anybody else, and, therefore, content with himself. He
has, therefore, kept much of his medi&aelig;val impedimenta,
his dukes and marquesses and all that they imply&mdash;his
outworn ceremonies and his medi&aelig;val disregard of his
social inferiors. Nothing is well done in this Kingdom
for the big public, but only for the classes. The railway
stations have no warm waiting rooms. The people pace
the platform till the train comes, and milord sits snugly
wrapt up in his carriage till his footman announces the
approach of the train. And occasional discontent is relieved
by emigration to the Colonies. If any man becomes
weary of his restrictions he may go to Australia
and become a gentleman. The remarkable loyalty of
the Colonies has in it something of a servant's devotion
to his old master.</p>

<p>Now this trying time of war and the threat and danger
of extinction are bringing&mdash;have in fact already brought&mdash;the
conviction that many changes must come. The
first sensible talk about popular education ever heard here
is just now beginning. Many a gentleman has made up
his mind to try to do with less than seventeen servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-344" id="page2-344"></a>[pg II-344]</span>
for the rest of his life since he now <i>has</i> to do with less.
Privilege, on which so large a part of life here rests, is already
pretty well shot to pieces. A lot of old baggage
will never be recovered after this war: that's certain.
During a little after-dinner speech in a club not long ago
I indulged in a pleasantry about excessive impedimenta.
Lord Derby, Minister of War and a bluff and honest
aristocrat, sat near me and he whispered to me&mdash;&quot;That's
me.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;that's you,&quot; and the group about
us made merry at the jest. The meaning of this is, they
now joke about what was the most solemn thing in life
three years ago.</p>

<p>None of this conveys the idea I am trying to explain&mdash;the
change in the English point of view and outlook&mdash;a
half century's change in less than three years, radical and
fundamental change, too. The mother of the Duke of X
came to see me this afternoon, hobbling on her sticks and
feeble, to tell me of a radiant letter she had received from
her granddaughter who has been in Washington visiting the
Spring Rices. &quot;It's all very wonderful,&quot; said the venerable
lady, &quot;and my granddaughter actually heard the President
make a speech!&quot; Now, knowing this lady and
knowing her son, the Duke, and knowing how this girl,
his daughter, has been brought up, I dare swear that three
years ago not one of them would have crossed the street
to hear any President that ever lived. They've simply
become different people. They were very genuine before.
They are very genuine now.</p>

<p>It is this steadfastness in them that gives me sound hope
for the future. They don't forget sympathy or help or
friendship. Our going into the war has eliminated the
Japanese question. It has shifted the virtual control of
the world to English-speaking peoples. It will bring into
the best European minds the American ideal of service.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-345" id="page2-345"></a>[pg II-345]</span>
It will, in fact, give us the lead and make the English in
the long run our willing followers and allies. I don't
mean that we shall always have plain sailing. But I do
mean that the direction of events for the next fifty or
one hundred years has now been determined.</p>

<p>Yet Page found one stolid opposition to his attempts
to establish the friendliest relations between the two peoples.
That offish attitude of the Washington Administration,
to which reference has already been made, did not
soften with the progress of events. Another experience
now again brought out President Wilson's coldness toward
his allies. About this time many rather queer Americans&mdash;some
of the &quot;international&quot; breed&mdash;were coming to England
on more or less official missions. Page was somewhat
humiliated by these excursions; he knew that his country
possessed an almost unlimited supply of vivid speakers,
filled with zeal for the allied cause, whose influence, if
they could be induced to cross the Atlantic, would put
new spirit into the British. The idea of having a number
of distinguished Americans come to England and tell the
British public about the United States and especially
about the American preparations for war, was one that
now occupied his thoughts. In June, 1917, he wrote his
old friend Dr. Wallace Buttrick, extending an invitation
to visit Great Britain as a guest of the British Government.
Dr. Buttrick made a great success; his speeches drew
large crowds and proved a source of inspiration to the
British masses. So successful were they, indeed, that the
British Government desired that other Americans of
similar type should come and spread the message. In
November, therefore, Dr. Buttrick returned to the
United States for the purpose of organizing such a committee.
Among the eminent Americans whom he persuaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-346" id="page2-346"></a>[pg II-346]</span>
to give several months of their time to this work
of heartening our British allies were Mr. George E. Vincent,
President of the Rockefeller Foundation, Mr. Harry Pratt
Judson, President of Chicago University, Mr. Charles
H. Van Hise, President of the University of Wisconsin,
Mr. Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of
Virginia, Mr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, and Bishop Lawrence
of Massachusetts. It was certainly a distinguished
group, but it was the gentleman selected to be its head
that gave it almost transcendent importance in the eyes
of the British Government. This was ex-President William
H. Taft. The British lay greater emphasis upon
official rank than do Americans, and the fact that an ex-President
of the United States was to head this delegation
made it almost an historic event. Mr. Taft was exceedingly
busy, but he expressed his willingness to give up all
his engagements for several months and to devote his
energies to enlightening the British public about America
and its purposes in the war. An official invitation was
sent him from London and accepted.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Mr. Taft was an ex-President and a
representative of the political party opposed to the one
in power, he thought it only courteous that he call upon
Mr. Wilson, explain the purpose of his mission, and obtain
his approval. He therefore had an interview with the
President at the White House; the date was December 12,
1917. As soon as Mr. Wilson heard of the proposed visit
to Great Britain he showed signs of irritation. He at
once declared that it met with his strongest disapproval.
When Mr. Taft remarked that the result of such an enterprise
would be to draw Great Britain and the United States
more closely together, Mr. Wilson replied that he seriously
questioned the desirability of drawing the two countries
any more closely together than they already were. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-347" id="page2-347"></a>[pg II-347]</span>
was opposed to putting the United States in a position of
seeming in any way to be involved with British policy.
There were divergencies of purpose, he said, and there were
features of the British policy in this war of which he heartily
disapproved. The motives of the United States in this
war, the President continued, &quot;were unselfish, but the
motives of Great Britain seemed to him to be of a less
unselfish character.&quot; Mr. Wilson cited the treaty between
Great Britain and Italy as a sample of British
statesmanship which he regarded as proving this contention.
The President's reference to this Italian treaty
has considerable historic value; there has been much discussion
as to when the President first learned of its
existence, but it is apparent from this conversation with
ex-President Taft that he must have known about it
on December 12, 1917, for President Wilson based his
criticism of British policy largely upon this Italian
convention<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67" /><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>The President showed more and more feeling about the
matter as the discussion continued. &quot;There are too many
Englishmen,&quot; he said, &quot;in this country and in Washington
now and I have asked the British Ambassador to have
some of them sent home.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson referred to the jealousy of France at the
close relations which were apparently developing between
Great Britain and the United States. This was another
reason, he thought, why it was unwise to make the bonds
between them any tighter. He also called Mr. Taft's
attention to the fact that there were certain elements in
the United States which were opposed to Great Britain&mdash;this
evidently being a reference to the Germans and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-348" id="page2-348"></a>[pg II-348]</span>
Irish&mdash;and he therefore believed that any conspicuous
attempts to increase the friendliness of the two countries
for each other would arouse antagonism and resentment.</p>

<p>As Mr. Taft was leaving he informed Mr. Wilson that
the plan for his visit and that of the other speakers had
originated with the American Ambassador to Great Britain.
This, however, did not improve the President's
temper.</p>

<p>&quot;Page,&quot; said the President, &quot;is really an Englishman
and I have to discount whatever he says about the situation
in Great Britain.&quot;</p>

<p>And then he added, &quot;I think you ought not to go, and
the same applies to the other members of the party. I
would like you to make my attitude on this question known
to those having the matter in charge.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite this rebuff Dr. Buttrick and Mr. Taft were
reluctant to give up the plan. An appeal was therefore
made to Colonel House. Colonel House at once said
that the proposed visit was an excellent thing and that
he would make a personal appeal to Mr. Wilson in the
hope of changing his mind. A few days afterward Colonel
House called up Dr. Buttrick and informed him that
he had not succeeded. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; wrote Colonel
House to Page, &quot;that the Buttrick speaking programme
has turned out as it has. The President was decidedly
opposed to it and referred to it with some feeling.&quot;</p>

<h3>GETTING THE AMERICAN TROOPS TO FRANCE</h3>


<p>A group of letters, written at this time, touch upon
a variety of topics which were then engaging the
interest of all countries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>To Arthur W. Page</i><br />
<br />
London, January 19, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>While your letter is still fresh in my mind I dictate
the following in answer to your question about Palestine.</p>

<p>It has not been settled&mdash;and cannot be, I fancy, until
the Peace Conference&mdash;precisely what the British will do
with Palestine, but I have what I think is a correct idea
of their general attitude on the subject. First, of course,
they do not propose to allow it to go back into Turkish
hands; and the same can be said also of Armenia and possibly
of Mesopotamia. Their idea of the future of Palestine
is that whoever shall manage the country, or however
it shall be managed, the Jews shall have the same chance
as anybody else. Of course that's quite an advance for
the Jews there, but their idea is not that the Jews should
have command of other populations there or control over
them&mdash;not in the least. My guess at the English wish,
which I have every reason to believe is the right guess,
is that they would wish to have Palestine internationalized,
whatever that means. That is to say, that it
should have control of its own local affairs and be a free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-350" id="page2-350"></a>[pg II-350]</span>
country but that some great Power, or number of Powers,
should see to it that none of the races that live there should
be allowed to impose upon the other races. I don't know
just how such a guarantee can be given by the great
Powers or such a responsibility assumed except by an
agreement among two or three of them, or barely possibly
by the English keeping control themselves; but the control
by the English after the war of the former German
colonies will put such a large task on them that they will
not be particularly eager to extend the area of their
responsibility elsewhere. Of course a difficult problem will
come up also about Constantinople and the Dardanelles.
The Dardanelles must be internationalized.</p>

<p>I have never been able to consider the Zionist movement
seriously. It is a mere religious sentiment which
will express itself in action by very few people. I have
asked a number of Jews at various times who are in favour
of the Zionist movement if they themselves are going
there. They always say no. The movement, therefore,
has fixed itself in my mind as a Jewish movement in which
no Jew that you can lay your hands on will ever take part
but who wants other Jews to take part in it. Of course
there might be a flocking to Palestine of Jews from Russia
and the adjoining countries where they are not happy,
but I think the thing is chiefly a sentiment and nothing
else. Morgenthau<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68" /><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> is dead right. I agree with him <i>in
toto</i>. I do not think anybody in the United States need
be the least concerned about the Zionist movement because
there isn't a single Jew in our country such a fool
as to go to Palestine when he can stay in the United States.
The whole thing is a sentimental, religious, more or less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-351" id="page2-351"></a>[pg II-351]</span>
unnatural and fantastic idea and I don't think will ever
trouble so practical a people as we and our Jews are.</p></div>

<p>The following memorandum is dated February 10, 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>General Bliss<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69" /><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> has made a profound and the best possible
impression here by his wisdom and his tact. The
British have a deep respect for him and for his opinions,
and in inspiring and keeping high confidence in us he is
worth an army in himself. I have seen much of him and
found out a good deal about his methods. He is simplicity
and directness itself. Although he is as active and
energetic as a boy, he spends some time by himself to
think things out and even to say them to himself to see
how his conclusions strike the ear as well as the mind.
He has been staying here at the house of one of our resident
officers. At times he goes to his room and sits long
by the fire and argues his point&mdash;out loud&mdash;oblivious to
everything else. More than once when he was so engaged
one of his officers has knocked at the door and gone
in and laid telegrams on the table beside him and gone out
without his having known of the officer's entrance. Then
he comes out and tries his conclusion on someone who
enjoys his confidence. And then he stands by it and when
the time comes delivers it slowly and with precision; and
there he is; and those who hear him see that he has thought
the matter out on all sides and finally.</p>

<p>Our various establishments in London have now become
big&mdash;the Embassy proper, the Naval and Army Headquarters,
the Red Cross, the War Trade Board's representatives,
and now (forthwith) the Shipping Board, besides
Mr. Crosby of the Treasury. The volume of work is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-352" id="page2-352"></a>[pg II-352]</span>
enormous and it goes smoothly, except for the somewhat
halting Army Headquarters, the high personnel of which
is now undergoing a change; and that will now be all right.
I regularly make the rounds of all the Government Departments
with which we deal to learn if they find our men
and methods effective, and the rounds of all our centres
of activity to find whether there be any friction with
the British The whole machine moves very well. For
neither side hesitates to come to me whenever they strike
even small snags. All our people are at work on serious
tasks and (so far as I know) there are now none of those
despicable creatures here who used during our neutrality
days to come from the United States on peace errands
and what-not to spy on the Embassy and me (their inquiries
and their correspondence were catalogued by the
police). I have been amazed at the activity of some of
them whose doings I have since been informed of.</p>

<p>We now pay this tribute to the submarines&mdash;that we
have entered the period of compulsory rations. There is
enough to eat in spite of the food that has gone to feed
the fishes. But no machinery of distribution to a whole
population can be uniformly effective. The British
worker with his hands is a greedy feeder and a sturdy
growler and there will be trouble. But I know no reason
to apprehend serious trouble.</p>

<p>The utter break-up of Russia and the German present
occupation of so much of the Empire as she wants have
had a contrary effect on two sections of opinion here, as I
interpret the British mind. On the undoubtedly enormously
dominant section of opinion these events have
only stiffened resolution. They say that Germany now
must be whipped to a finish. Else she will have doubled
her empire and will hold the peoples of her new territory
as vassals without regard to their wishes and the war lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-353" id="page2-353"></a>[pg II-353]</span>
caste will be more firmly seated than ever before. If her
armies be literally whipped she'll have to submit to the
Allies' terms, which will dislodge her from overlordship over
these new unwilling subjects&mdash;and she can be dislodged
in no other way. This probably means a long war, now
that after a time she can get raw materials for war later
and food from Rumania and the Ukraine, etc. This will
mean a fight in France and Belgium till a decisive victory
is won and the present exultant German will is broken.</p>

<p>The minority section of public opinion&mdash;as I judge a
small minority&mdash;has the feeling that such an out-and-out
military victory cannot be won or is not worth the price;
and that the enemies of Germany, allowing her to keep her
Eastern accretions, must make the best terms they can
in the East; that there's no use in running the risk of
Italy's defeat and defection before some sort of bargain
could be made about Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine, and Serbia.
Of course this plan would leave the German warlordship
intact and would bring no sort of assurance of a prolonged
peace. It would, too, leave European Russia at least to
German mercy, and would leave the Baltic and the Black
Seas practically wholly under German influence. As for
the people of Russia, there seems small chance for them
in this second contingency. The only way to save them
is to win a decisive victory.</p>

<p>As matters stand to-day Lord Lansdowne and his
friends (how numerous they are nobody knows) are the
loudest spokesmen for such a peace as can be made. But
it is talked much of in Asquith circles that the time may
come when this policy will be led by Mr. Asquith, in a
form somewhat modified from the Lansdowne formula.
Mr. Asquith has up to this time patriotically supported
the government and he himself has said nothing in public
which could warrant linking his name with an early peace-seeking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-354" id="page2-354"></a>[pg II-354]</span>
policy. But his friends openly and incessantly
predict that he will, at a favourable moment, take this
cue. I myself can hardly believe it. Political victory
in Great Britain doesn't now lie in that direction.</p>

<p>The dominant section of opinion is much grieved at
Russia's surrender, but they refuse to be discouraged by it.
They recall how Napoleon overran most of Europe, and the
French held practically none of his conquests after his fall.</p>

<p>Such real political danger as exists here&mdash;if any exists,
of which I am not quite sure&mdash;comes not only now mainly
of this split in public opinion but also and to a greater
degree from the personal enemies of the present government.
Lloyd George is kept in power because he is the
most energetic man in sight&mdash;by far. Many who support
him do not like him nor trust him-except that nobody
doubts his supreme earnestness to win the war. On all
other subjects he has enemies of old and he makes new
ones. His intense and superb energy has saved him in
two notable crises. His dismissal of Sir William Robertson<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70" /><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
has been accepted in the interest of greater unity of
military control, but it was a dangerous rapids that he
shot, for he didn't do it tactfully. Yet there's a certain
danger to the present powers in the feeling that some
of them are wearing out. Parliament itself&mdash;an old one
now&mdash;is thought to have gone stale. Bonar Law is over-worked
and tired; Balfour is often said to be too philosophical
and languid; but, when this feeling seems in danger

<i>To the President</i><br />
<br />
London, March 17, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>The rather impatient and unappreciative remarks made
by the Prime Minister before a large meeting of preachers
of the &quot;free&quot; churches about a League of Nations reminds
me to write you about the state of British opinion on that
subject. What Lloyd George said to these preachers is
regrettable because it showed a certain impatience of
mind from which he sometimes suffers; but it is only fair
to him to say that his remarks that day did not express a
settled opinion. For on more than one previous occasion
he has spoken of the subject in a wholly different tone&mdash;much
more appreciatively. On that particular day he had
in mind only the overwhelming necessity to win the war&mdash;other
things, <i>all</i> other things must wait. In a way this is
his constant mood&mdash;the mood to make everybody feel
that the only present duty is to win the war. He has
been accused of almost every defect in the calendar except
of slackness about the war. Nobody has ever doubted
his earnestness nor his energy about <i>that</i>. And the universal
confidence in his energy and earnestness is what
keeps him in office. Nobody sees any other man who can
push and inspire as well as he does. It would be a mistake,
therefore, to pay too much heed to any particular
utterance of this electrical creature of moods, on any subject.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he hasn't thought out the project of a
league to enforce peace further than to see the difficulties.
He sees that such a league might mean, in theory
at least, the giving over in some possible crisis the command
of the British Fleet to an officer of some other nationality.
That's unthinkable to any red-blooded son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-356" id="page2-356"></a>[pg II-356]</span>
these islands. Seeing a theoretical possibility even of
raising such a question, the British mind stops and refuses
to go further&mdash;refuses in most cases even to inquire seriously
whether any such contingency is ever likely to come.</p>

<p>The British Grand Fleet, in fact, is a subject that stands
alone in power and value and in difficulties. It classifies
itself with nothing else. Since over and over again it has
saved these islands from invasion when nothing else could
have saved them and since during this war in particular
it has saved the world from German conquest&mdash;as every
Englishman believes&mdash;it lies in their reverence and their
gratitude and their abiding convictions as a necessary
and perpetual shield so long as Great Britain shall endure.
If the Germans are thrashed to a frazzle (and we haven't
altogether done that yet) and we set about putting the
world in order, when we come to discuss Disarmament,
the British Fleet will be the most difficult item in the world
to dispose of. It is not only a Fact, with a great and saving
history, it is also a sacred Tradition and an Article of Faith.</p>

<p>The first reason, therefore, why the British general mind
has not firmly got hold on a league is the instinctive fear
that the formation of any league may in some conceivable
way affect the Grand Fleet. Another reason is the general
inability of a somewhat slow public opinion to take hold
on more than one subject at a time or more than one
urgent part of one subject. The One Subject, of course,
is winning the war. Since everything else depends on that,
everything else must wait on that.</p>

<p>The League, therefore, has not taken hold on the public
imagination here as it has in the United States. The
large mass of the people have not thought seriously about
it: it has not been strongly and persistently presented to
the mass of the people. There is no popular or general
organization to promote it. There is even, here and there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-357" id="page2-357"></a>[pg II-357]</span>
condemnation of the idea. The (London) <i>Morning Post</i>,
for example, goes out of its way once in a while to show
the wickedness of the idea because, so it argues, it will involve
the sacrifice, more or less, of nationality. But the
<i>Morning Post</i> is impervious to new ideas and is above all
things critical in its activities and very seldom constructive.
The typical Tory mind in general sees no good in the
idea. The typical Tory mind is the insular mind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the League idea is understood as a
necessity and heartily approved by two powerful sections
of public opinion&mdash;(1) the group of public men who have
given attention to it, such as Bryce, Lord Robert Cecil,
and the like, and (2) some of the best and strongest leaders
of Labour. There is good reason to hope that whenever
a fight and an agitation is made for a League these two
sections of public opinion will win; but an agitation and a
fight must come. Lord Bryce, in the intervals of his work
as chairman of a committee to make a plan for the
reorganization of the House of Lords, which, he remarked to
me the other day, &quot;involves as much labour as a Government
Department,&quot; has fits of impatience about pushing
a campaign for a league, and so have a few other men.
They ask me if it be not possible to have good American
public speakers come here&mdash;privately, of course, and in
no way connected with our Government nor speaking for
it&mdash;to explain the American movement for a League in
order to arouse a public sentiment on the subject.</p>

<p>Thus the case stands at present.</p>

<p>Truth and error alike and odd admixtures of them come
in waves over this censored land where one can seldom
determine what is true, before the event, from the
newspapers. &quot;News&quot; travels by word of mouth, and
information that one can depend on is got by personal
inquiry from sources that can be trusted.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-358" id="page2-358"></a>[pg II-358]</span>
<p>There is a curious wave of fear just now about what
Labour may do, and the common gossip has it that there
is grave danger in the situation. I can find no basis for
such a fear. I have talked with labour leaders and I
have talked with members of the government who know
most about the subject. There is not a satisfactory
situation&mdash;there has not been since the war began. There has
been a continuous series of labour &quot;crises,&quot; and there have
been a good many embarrassing strikes, all of which have
first been hushed up and settled&mdash;at least postponed.
One cause of continuous trouble has been the notion held
by the Unions, sometimes right and sometimes wrong,
that the employers were making abnormal profits and
that they were not getting their due share. There have
been and are also other causes of trouble. It was a continuous
quarrel even in peace times. But I can find no
especial cause of fear now. Many of the Unions have had
such advances of wages that the Government has been
severely criticized for giving in. Just lately a large wing
of the Labour Party put forth its war aims which&mdash;with
relatively unimportant exceptions&mdash;coincide with the best
declarations made by the Government's own spokesmen.</p>

<p>Of course, no prudent man would venture to make
dogmatic predictions. There have been times when for
brief intervals any one would have been tempted to fear
that these quarrels might cause an unsatisfactory conclusion
of the war. But the undoubted patriotism of the
British workman has every time saved the situation.
While a danger point does lie here, there is no reason to be
more fearful now than at any preceding time when no
especial trouble was brewing. This wave of gossip and
fear has no right to sweep over the country now.</p>

<p>Labour hopes and expects and is preparing to win the
next General Election&mdash;whether with good reason or not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-359" id="page2-359"></a>[pg II-359]</span>
I cannot guess. But most men expect it to win the
Government at some time&mdash;most of them <i>after</i> the war.
I recall that Lord Grey once said to me, before the war
began, that a general political success of the Labour Party
was soon to be expected.</p>

<p>Another wave which, I hear, has swept over Rome as
well as London is a wave of early peace expectation. The
British newspapers have lately been encouraging this by
mysterious phrases. Some men here of good sense and
sound judgment think that this is the result of the so-called
German &quot;peace offensive,&quot; which makes the present
the most dangerous period of the war.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR HOUSTON:</p>

<p>It is very kind of you indeed to write so generously
about the British visitors who are invading our sacred
premises, such as the Archbishop of York, and it is good
to hear from you anyhow about any subject and I needn't
say that it is quite a rare experience also. I wish you
would take a little of your abundant leisure and devote it
to good letters to me.</p>

<p>And in some one of your letters tell me this.&mdash;The
British send over men of this class that you have written
about to see us, but they invite over here&mdash;and we permit
to come&mdash;cranks on prohibition, experts in the investigation
of crime, short-haired women who wish to see how
British babies are reared, peace cranks and freaks of other
kinds<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73" /><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Our Government apparently won't let plain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-360" id="page2-360"></a>[pg II-360]</span>
honest, normal civilians come over, but if a fellow comes
along who wants to investigate some monstrosity then
one half of the Senate, one half of the House of Representatives,
and a number of the executive offices of the Government
give him the most cordial letters. Now there are
many things, of course, that I don't know, but it has been
my fate to have a pretty extensive acquaintance with
cranks of every description in the United States. I
don't think there is any breed of them that didn't haunt
my office while I was an editor. Now I am surely punished
for all my past sins by having those fellows descend
on me here. I know them, nearly all, from past experience
and now just for the sake of keeping the world as
quiet as possible I have to give them time here far out of
proportion to their value.</p>

<p>Now, out of your great wisdom, I wish you would explain
to me why the deuce we let all this crew come over
here instead of sending a shipload of perfectly normal,
dignified, and right-minded gentlemen. These thug reformers!&mdash;Baker
will be here in a day or two and if I can
remember it I am going to suggest to him that he round
them all up and put them in the trenches in France where
those of them who have so far escaped the gallows ought
to be put.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to have the illuminating statement
about our crops. I am going to show it to certain gentlemen
here who will be much cheered by it. By gracious,
you ought to hear their appreciation of what we are doing!
We are not doing it for the sake of their appreciation, but
if we were out to win it we could not do it better. Down
at bottom the Englishman is a good fellow. He has his
faults but he doesn't get tired and he doesn't suffer spasms
of emotion.</p>

<p>Give my love to Mrs. Houston, and do sit down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-361" id="page2-361"></a>[pg II-361]</span>
write me a good long letter&mdash;a whole series of them, in
fact.</p>

<br />
London, March 22, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. POLK:</p>

<p>You are good enough to mention the fact that the Embassy
has some sort of grievance against the Department.
Of course it has, and you are, possibly, the only man that
can remove it. It is this: You don't come here to see the
war and this government and these people who are again
saving the world as we are now saving them. I thank
Heaven and the Administration for Secretary Baker's
visit. It is a dramatic moment in the history of the race,
of democracy, and of the world. The State Department
has the duty to deal with foreign affairs&mdash;the especial
duty&mdash;and yet no man in the State Department has been
here since the war began. This doesn't look pretty and
it won't look pretty when the much over-worked &quot;future
historian&quot; writes it down in a book. Remove that
grievance.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing going on in the world to-day&mdash;a
thing that in History will transcend the war and be
reckoned its greatest gain&mdash;is the high leadership of
the President in formulating the struggle, in putting
its aims high, and in taking the democratic lead in the
world, a lead that will make the world over&mdash;and in
taking the democratic lead of the English-speaking folk.
Next most impressive to that is to watch the British
response to that lead. Already they have doubled the
number of their voters, and even more important definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-362" id="page2-362"></a>[pg II-362]</span>
steps in Democracy will be taken. My aim&mdash;and it's
the only way to save the world&mdash;is to lead the British
in this direction. They are the most easily teachable
people in our way of thinking and of doing. Of
course everybody who works toward such an aim
provokes the cry from a lot of fools among us who
accuse him of toadying to the English and of &quot;accepting
the conventional English conclusion.&quot; They had as
well talk of missionaries to India accepting Confucius
or Buddha. Their fleet has saved us four or five times.
It's about time we were saving them from this bloods
Thing that we call Europe, for our sake and for
theirs.</p>

<p>The bloody Thing will get us all if we don't fight our
level best; and it's only by <i>our</i> help that we'll be saved.
That clearly gives us the leadership. Everybody sees
that. Everybody acknowledges it. The President authoritatively
speaks it&mdash;speaks leadership on a higher level
than it was ever spoken before to the whole world. As
soon as we get this fighting job over, the world procession
toward freedom&mdash;our kind of freedom&mdash;will begin under
our lead. This being so, can't you delegate the writing of
telegrams about &quot;facilitating the license to ship poppy
seed to McKesson and Robbins,&quot; and come over and see
big world-forces at work?</p>

<p>I cannot express my satisfaction at Secretary Baker's
visit. It was historic&mdash;the first member of the Cabinet,
I think, who ever came here while he held office. He
made a great impression and received a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>That's the only grievance I can at the moment unload
on you. We're passing out of our old era of isolation.
These benighted heathen on this island whom we'll yet
save (since they are well worth saving) will be with us as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-363" id="page2-363"></a>[pg II-363]</span>
we need them in future years and centuries. Come, help
us heighten this fine spirit.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Always heartily yours,<br />
<br />
WALTER HINES PAGE.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P.S. You'd see how big our country looks from a distance.
It's gigantic, I assure you.</p></div>

<p>The above letter was written on what was perhaps the
darkest day of the whole war. The German attack on
the Western Front, which had been long expected, had
now been launched, and, at the moment that Page was
penning this cheery note to Mr. Polk, the German armies
had broken through the British defenses, had pushed their
lines forty miles ahead, and, in the judgment of many
military men, had Paris almost certainly within their
grasp. A great German gun, placed about seventy miles
from the French capital, was dropping shells upon the
apparently doomed city. This attack had been regarded
as inevitable since the collapse of Russia, which had enabled
the Germans to concentrate practically all their
armies on the Western Front.</p>

<p>The world does not yet fully comprehend the devastating
effect of this apparently successful attack upon
the allied morale. British statesmen and British soldiers
made no attempt to conceal from official Americans the
desperate state of affairs. It was the expectation that
the Germans might reach Calais and thence invade England.
The War Office discussed these probabilities most
freely with Colonel Slocum, the American military attach&eacute;.
The simple fact was that both the French and the British
armies were practically bled white.</p>

<p>&quot;For God's sake, get your men over!&quot; they urged General
Slocum. &quot;You have got to finish it.&quot;</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-364" id="page2-364"></a>[pg II-364]</span></div>
<p>Page was writing urgently to President Wilson to the
same purpose. Send the men and send them at once.
&quot;I pray God,&quot; were his solemn words to Mr. Wilson,
&quot;that you will not be too late!&quot;</p>

<p>One propitious event had taken place at the same time as
the opening of the great German offensive. Mr. Newton
D. Baker, the American Secretary of War, had left
quietly for France in late February, 1918, and had reached
the Western Front in time to obtain a first-hand sight of
the great March drive. No visit in history has ever been
better timed, and no event could have better played into
Page's hands. He had been urging Washington to send
all available forces to France at the earliest possible date;
he knew, as probably few other men knew, the extent to
which the Allies were depending upon American troops to
give the final blow to Germany; and the arrival of Secretary
Baker at the scene of action gave him the opportunity
to make a personal appeal. Page immediately
communicated with the Secretary and persuaded him to
come at once to London for a consultation with British
military and political leaders. The Secretary spent only
three days in London, but the visit, brief as it was, had
historic consequences. He had many consultations with
the British military men; he entered into their plans with
enthusiasm; he himself received many ideas that afterward
took shape in action, and the British Government
obtained from him first-hand information as to the progress
of the American Army and the American determination
to cooperate to the last man and the last dollar.
&quot;Baker went straight back to France,&quot; Page wrote to his
son Arthur, &quot;and our whole co&ouml;peration began.&quot;</p>

<p>Page gave a dinner to Mr. Baker at the Embassy on
March 23rd&mdash;two days after the great March drive had
begun. This occasion gave the visitor a memorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-365" id="page2-365"></a>[pg II-365]</span>
glimpse of the British temperament. Mr. Lloyd George,
Mr. Balfour, Lord Derby, the War Secretary, General
Biddle, of the United States Army, and Admiral Sims were
the Ambassador's guests. Though the mighty issues then
overhanging the world were not ignored in the conversation
the atmosphere hardly suggested that the existence of the
British Empire, indeed that of civilization itself, was that
very night hanging in the balance. Possibly it was the
general sombreness of events that caused these British
statesmen to find a certain relief in jocular small talk and
reminiscence. For the larger part of the evening not
a word was said about the progress of the German armies
in France. Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour, seated on
opposite sides of the table, apparently found relaxation in
reviewing their political careers and especially their old-time
political battles. They would laughingly recall occasions
when, in American parlance, they had put each other
&quot;in a hole&quot;; the exigencies of war had now made these two
men colleagues in the same government, but the twenty
years preceding 1914 they had spent in political antagonism.
Page's guests on this occasion learned much political
history of the early twentieth century, and the mutual
confessions of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour gave
these two men an insight into each others' motives and
manoeuvres which was almost as revealing. &quot;Yes, you
caught me that time,&quot; Mr. Lloyd George would say, and
then he would counter with an episode of a political battle
in which he had got the better of Mr. Balfour. The whole
talk was lively and bantering, and accompanied with
much laughter; and all this time shells from that long-distance
gun were dropping at fifteen minute intervals
upon the devoted women and children of Paris and the
Germans were every hour driving the British back in disorder.
At times the conversation took a more philosophic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-366" id="page2-366"></a>[pg II-366]</span>
turn. Would the men present like to go back twenty-five
years and live their lives all over again? The practically
unanimous decision of every man was that he would
not wish to do so.</p>

<p>All this, of course, was merely on the surface; despite
the laughter and the banter, there was only one thing which
engrossed the Ambassador's guests, although there were
not many references to it. That was the struggle which
was then taking place in France. At intervals Mr. Lloyd
George would send one of the guests, evidently a secretary,
from the room. The latter, on his return, would
whisper something in the Prime Minister's ear, but more
frequently he would merely shake his head. Evidently
he had been sent to obtain the latest news of the
battle.</p>

<p>At one point the Prime Minister did refer to the great
things taking place in France.</p>

<p>&quot;This battle means one thing,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a
generalissimo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why couldn't you have taken this step long ago?&quot;
Admiral Sims asked Mr. Lloyd George.</p>

<p>The answer came like a flash.</p>

<p>&quot;If the cabinet two weeks ago had suggested placing
the British Army under a foreign general, it would have
fallen. Every cabinet in Europe would also have fallen,
had it suggested such a thing.&quot;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Memorandum on Secretary Baker's visit</i></p>

<p>Secretary Baker's visit here, brief as it was, gave the
heartiest satisfaction. So far as I know, he is the first
member of an American Cabinet who ever came to England
while he held office, as Mr. Balfour was the first
member of a British Cabinet who ever went to the United
States while he held office. The great governments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-367" id="page2-367"></a>[pg II-367]</span>
the English-speaking folk have surely dealt with one another
with mighty elongated tongs. Governments of
democracies are not exactly instruments of precision. But
they are at least human. But personal and human neglect
of one another by these two governments over so long a
period is an astonishing fact in our history. The wonder
is that we haven't had more than two wars. And it is no
wonder that the ignorance of Englishmen about America
and the American ignorance of England are monumental,
stupendous, amazing, passing understanding. I have
on my mantelpiece a statuette of Benjamin Franklin,
an excellent and unmistakable likeness which was made
here during his lifetime; and the inscription burnt on its
base is <i>Geo. Washington</i>. It serves me many a good turn
with my English friends. I use it as a measure of their
ignorance of us. Of course this is a mere little error of a
statuette-maker, an error, moreover, of a hundred years
ago. But it tells the story of to-day also. If I had to
name the largest and most indelible impression that
has been made on me during my five years' work
here, I should say the ignorance and aloofness of the
two peoples&mdash;not an ignorance of big essential facts
but of personalities and temperaments&mdash;such as never
occur except between men who had never seen one
another.</p>

<p>But I was writing about Mr. Baker's visit and I've
got a long way from that. I doubt if he knows himself
what gratification it gave; for these men here have
spoken to me about it as they could not speak to
him.</p>

<p>Here is an odd fact: For sixty years, so far as I know,
members of the Administration have had personal acquaintance
with some of the men in power in Salvador,
Costa Rica, Venezuela, Peru, etc., etc., and members of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-368" id="page2-368"></a>[pg II-368]</span>
the British Government have had personal acquaintance
with some men in authority in Portugal, Serbia, Montenegro
and Monte Carlo; but during this time (with the
single exception of John Hay) I think no member of any
Administration had a real personal acquaintance while he
held office with any member of the British Government
while he held office, and vice versa&mdash;till Mr. Balfour's
visit. Suspicion grows out of ignorance. The longer I
live here the more astonished I become at the fundamental
ignorance of the British about us and of our fundamental
ignorance about them. So colossal is this ignorance that
every American sent here is supposed to be taken in, to
become Anglophile; and often when one undertakes to
enlighten Englishmen about the United States one becomes
aware of a feeling inside the English of unbelief, as
if he said, &quot;Oh, well! you are one of those queer people
who believe in republican government.&quot; All this is simply
amazing. Poor Admiral Sims sometimes has a sort
of mania, a delusion that nobody at Washington trusts
his judgment because he said seven or eight years ago
that he liked the English. Yet every naval officer who
comes here, I understand, shares his views about practically
every important naval problem or question. I don't
deserve the compliment (it's a very high one) that some of
my secretaries sometimes pay me when they say that I
am the only man they know who tries to tell the whole
truth to our Government in favour of the Englishman as
well as against him. It is certain that American public
opinion is universally supposed to suspect any American
who tries to do anything with the British lion except to
twist his tail&mdash;a supposition that I never believed to be
true.&mdash;But it is true that the mutual ignorance is as
high as the Andes and as deep as the ocean. Personal
acquaintance removes it and nothing else will.</p></div>

There's never been such a luxury, and anybody who supposes
that I am now going to get fat and have my cream
stopped simply doesn't know me. So, you see why I'm
intent on shredded wheat biscuits. That's about the best
form of real wheat that will keep. And there's no getting
real wheat-stuff, pure and simple, in any other form.</p>

<p>There's no use in talking about starving people&mdash;except
perhaps in India and China. White men can live on anything.
The English could fight a century on cabbage and
Brussels sprouts. I've given up hope of starving the
Germans. A gut of dogmeat or horse flesh and a potato
will keep them in fighting trim forever. I've read daily
for two years of impending starvation across the Rhine;
but I never even now hear of any dead ones from hunger.
Cold steel or lead is the only fatal dose for them.</p>

<p>Therefore I know that shredded wheat will carry me
through.</p>

<p>You'll see, I hope, from the clippings that I enclose
that I'm not done for yet anyhow. Two speeches a day
is no small stunt; and I did it again yesterday&mdash;hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-370" id="page2-370"></a>[pg II-370]</span>
running; and I went out to dinner afterward. It was a
notable occasion&mdash;this celebration of the anniversary of
our coming into the war<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74" /><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p>Nobody here knows definitely just what to fear from
the big battle; but everybody fears more or less. It's a
critical time&mdash;very. I am told that that long-range
gunning of Paris is the worst form of frightfulness yet
tried. The shells do not kill a great many people. But
their falling every fifteen minutes gets on people's nerves
and they can't sleep. I hear they are leaving Paris in
great numbers. Since the big battle began and the Germans
have needed all their planes and more in France,
they've let London alone. But nobody knows when they
will begin again.</p>

<p>Nobody knows any future thing about the war, and
everybody faces a fear.</p>

<p>Secretary Baker stayed with me the two days and three
nights he was here. He made a good impression but he
received a better one. He now knows something about
the war. I had at dinner to meet him:</p>

<p>Lloyd George, Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Balfour, Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>The Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>Lord Derby, War Secretary.</p>

<p>General Biddle, U.S.A., in command in London.</p>

<p>Admiral Sims, U.S.N.</p>

<p>The talk was to the point&mdash;good and earnest. Baker went
straight back to France and our <i>whole</i> co&ouml;peration began.
With the first group of four he had conferences besides
for two days. His coming was an admirable move.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR RALPH:</p>

<p>Your cheery letters about entertaining governors,
planting trees and shrubbery and your mother's little
orchard give us much pleasure. The Southern Pines
paper brings news of very great damage to the peach crop.
I hope it is much exaggerated. Is it?</p>

<p>We haven't any news here, and I send you my weekly
note only to keep my record clear. The great battle&mdash;no
one talks or thinks of anything else. We have suffered
and still suffer a good deal of fear and anxiety, with real
reason, too. But the military men are reassuring. Yet
I don't know just how far to trust their judgment or to
share their hopes. Certainly this is the most dangerous
situation that modern civilization was ever put in.
If we can keep them from winning any <i>great</i> objective,
like Paris or a channel port, we ought to end the war
this year. If not, either they win or at the least prolong
the war indefinitely. It's a hazardous and trying
time.</p>

<p>There were never such casualties on either side as now.
Such a bloody business cannot keep up all summer. But before
everybody is killed or a decisive conclusion is reached,
the armies will, no doubt, dig themselves in and take a
period of comparative rest. People here see and feel the
great danger. But the extra effort now <i>may</i> come too
late. Still we keep up good hope. The British are hard
to whip. They never give up. And as for the French
army, I always remember Verdun and keep my courage
up.</p>

<p>The wounded are coming over by the thousand. We
are incomparably busy and in great anxiety about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-372" id="page2-372"></a>[pg II-372]</span>
result (though still pretty firm in the belief that the Germans
will lose), and luckily we keep very well.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR RALPH:</p>

<p>There used to be a country parson down in Wake
County who, when other subjects were talked out, always
took up the pleasing topic of saving your soul. That's
the way your mother and I do&mdash;with the subject of going
home. We talk over the battle, we talk over the boys, we
talk over military and naval problems, we discuss the
weather and all the babies, and then take up politics, and
talk over the gossip of the wiseacres; but we seldom finish
a conversation without discussing going home. And we
reach just about as clear a conclusion on our topic as the
country parson reached on his. I've had the doctors
going over me (or rather your mother has) as an expert
accountant goes over your books; and I tried to bribe
them to say that I oughtn't to continue my arduous
duties here longer. They wouldn't say any such thing.
Thus that device failed&mdash;dead. It looks as if I were
destined for a green old age and no <i>martyr</i> business at
all.</p>

<p>All this is disappointing; and I don't see what to do but
to go on. I can't keep from hoping that the big battle
may throw some light on the subject; but there's no telling
when the big battle will end. Nothing ends&mdash;that's the
trouble. I sometimes feel that the war may never end,
that it may last as the Napoleonic Wars did, for 20 years;
and before that time we'll all have guns that shoot 100
miles. We can stay at home and indefinitely bombard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-373" id="page2-373"></a>[pg II-373]</span>
the enemy across the Rhine&mdash;have an endless battle at
long range.</p>

<p>So, we stick to it, and give the peach trees time to grow
up.</p>

<p>We had a big day in London yesterday&mdash;the anniversary
of our entry into the war. I send you some newspaper
clippings about it.</p>

<p>The next best news is that we have a little actual sunshine&mdash;a
very rare thing&mdash;and some of the weather is now
almost decent....</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI" />CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>LAST DAYS IN ENGLAND</h3>


<p>In spite of the encouraging tone of the foregoing
letters, everything was not well with Page. All through
the winter of 1917-1918 his associates at the Embassy had
noticed a change for the worse in his health. He seemed
to be growing thinner; his face was daily becoming more
haggard; he tired easily, and, after walking the short distance
from his house to his Embassy, he would drop listlessly
into his chair. His general bearing was that of a
man who was physically and nervously exhausted. It
was hoped that the holiday at St. Ives would help him;
that he greatly enjoyed that visit, especially the
westward&mdash;homeward&mdash;outlook on the Atlantic which it gave him,
his letters clearly show; there was a temporary improvement
also in his health, but only a temporary one. The
last great effort which he made in the interest of the common
cause was Secretary Baker's visit; the activities which
this entailed wearied him, but the pleasure he obtained
from the resultant increase in the American participation
made the experience one of the most profitable of his life.
Indeed, Page's last few months in England, though full of
sad memories for his friends, contained little but satisfaction
for himself. He still spent many a lonely evening
by his fire, but his thoughts were now far more pleasurable
than in the old <i>Lusitania</i> days. The one absorbing subject
of contemplation now was that America was &quot;in.&quot;
His country had justified his deep confidence. The American
Navy had played a determining part in defeating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-375" id="page2-375"></a>[pg II-375]</span>
submarine, and American shipyards were turning out
merchant ships faster than the Germans were destroying
them. American troops were reaching France at a rate
which necessarily meant the early collapse of the German
Empire. Page's own family had responded to the call
and this in itself was a cause of great contentment to
a sick and weary man. The Ambassador's youngest
son, Frank, had obtained a commission and was serving
in France; his son-in-law, Charles G. Loring, was
also on the Western Front; while from North Carolina
Page's youngest brother Frank and two nephews
had sailed for the open battle line. The bravery and
success of the American troops did not surprise the
Ambassador but they made his last days in England very
happy.</p>

<p>Indeed, every day had some delightful experience for
Page. The performance of the Americans at Cantigny
especially cheered him. The day after this battle he and
Mrs. Page entertained Mr. Lloyd George and other guests
at lunch. The Prime Minister came bounding into the
room with his characteristic enthusiasm, rushed up to
Mrs. Page with both hands outstretched and shook hands
joyously.</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;The Americans
have done it! They have met the Prussian guard and
defeated them!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George was as exuberant over the achievement
as a child.</p>

<p>This was now the kind of experience that had become
Page's daily routine. Lively as were his spirits, however,
his physical frame was giving way. In fact Page, though
he did not know it at the time, was suffering from a specific
disease&mdash;nephritis; and its course, after Christmas of
1917, became rapid. His old friend, Dr. Wallace Buttrick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-376" id="page2-376"></a>[pg II-376]</span>
had noted the change for the worse and had attempted to
persuade him to go home.</p>

<p>&quot;Quit your job, Page,&quot; he urged. &quot;You have other big
tasks waiting you at home. Why don't you go back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;not now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Page,&quot; urged Dr. Buttrick, &quot;you are going to lay
down your life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have only one life to lay down,&quot; was the reply. &quot;I
can't quit now.&quot;</p>

<br />
London, May 12, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MARY:</p>

<p>You'll have to take this big paper and this paint brush
pen&mdash;it's all the pen these blunt British have. This is to
tell you how very welcome your letter to Alice is&mdash;how
very welcome, for nobody writes us the family news and
nothing is so much appreciated. I'll try to call the shorter
roll of us in the same way:</p>

<p>After a miserable winter we, too, are having the rare
experience of a little sunshine in this dark, damp world of
London. The constant confinement in the city and <i>in
the house</i> (that's the worst of it&mdash;no outdoor life or fresh
air) has played hob with my digestion. It's not bad, but
it's troublesome, and for some time I've had the feeling of
being one half well. It occurred to me the other day that
I hadn't had leave from my work for four years, except
my short visit home nearly two years ago. I asked for two
months off, and I've got it. We are going down by the
shore where there is fresh air and where I can live outdoors
and get some exercise. We have a house that we can get
there and be comfortable. To get away from London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-377" id="page2-377"></a>[pg II-377]</span>
when the weather promises to be good, and to get away
from people seemed a joyous prospect. I can, at any time
I must, come to London in two hours.</p>

<p>The job's too important to give up at this juncture.
This, then, is the way we can keep it going. I've no such
hard task now as I had during the years of our neutrality,
which, praise God! I somehow survived, though I am
now suffering more or less from the physical effects of
that strain. Yet, since I have had the good fortune to
win the confidence of this Government and these people, I
feel that I ought to keep on now until some more or less
natural time to change comes.</p>

<p>Alice keeps remarkably well&mdash;since her influenza late
in the winter; but a rest away from London is really needed
as much by her as by me. They work her to death. In
a little while she is to go, by the invitation of the Government
and the consent of the King, to christen a new British
warship at Newcastle. It will be named the &quot;Eagle.&quot;
Meantime I'll be trying to get outdoor life at Sandwich.</p>

<p>Yesterday a regiment of our National Army marched
through the streets of London and were reviewed by the
King and me; and the town made a great day of it. While
there is an undercurrent of complaint in certain sections
of English opinion because we didn't come into the war
sooner, there is a very general and very genuine appreciation
of everything we have done and of all that we do.
Nothing could be heartier than the welcome given our
men here yesterday. Nor could any men have made
a braver or better showing than they made. They made
us all swell with pride.</p>

<p>They are coming over now, as you know, in great
quantities. There were about 8,000 landed here last week
and about 30,000 more are expected this week. I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-378" id="page2-378"></a>[pg II-378]</span>
that many more go direct to France than come through
England. On their way through England they do not
come to London. Only twice have we had them here,
yesterday and one day last summer when we had a parade
of a regiment of engineers. For the <i>army</i> London is on a
sidetrack&mdash;is an out of the way place. For our navy, of
course, it's the European headquarters, since Admiral
Sims has his headquarters here. We thus see a good
many of our sailors who are allowed to come to London on
leave. A few days ago I had a talk with a little bunch of
them who came from one of our superdreadnaughts in
the North Sea. They had just returned from a patrol
across to the coast of Norway. &quot;Bad luck, bad luck,&quot;
they said, &quot;on none of our long patrol trips have we seen
a single Hun ship!&quot;</p>

<p>About the war, you know as much as I know. There
is a general confidence that the Allies will hold the Germans
in their forthcoming effort to get to Calais or to
Paris. Yet there is an undercurrent of fear. Nobody
knows just how to feel about it. Probably another prodigious
onslaught will be made before you receive this
letter. It seems to me that we can make no intelligent
guess until this German effort is finished in France&mdash;no
guess about the future. If the Germans get the French
ports (Calais, for example) the war will go on indefinitely.
If they are held back, it <i>may</i> end next autumn or
winter&mdash;partly because of starvation in Germany and partly
because the Germans will have to confess that they can't
whip our armies in France. But, even then, since they
have all Russia to draw on, they may keep going for a long
time. One man's guess is as good as another's.</p>

<p>One sad thing is certain: we shall at once begin to have
heavy American casualties. Our Red Cross and our
army here are getting hospitals ready for such American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-379" id="page2-379"></a>[pg II-379]</span>
wounded as are brought over to England&mdash;the parts of
our army that are fighting with the British.</p>

<p>We have a lot of miserable politics here which interfere
with the public feeling. The British politician is a worse
yellow dog than the American&mdash;at times he is, at least;
and we have just been going through such a time. Another
such time will soon come about the Irish.</p>

<p>Well, we have an unending quantity of work and wear&mdash;no
very acute bothers but a continuous strain, the
strain of actual work, of uneasiness, of seeing people, of
uncertainty, of great expense, of doubt and fear at times,
of inability to make any plans&mdash;all which is only the common
lot now all over the world, except that most persons
have up to this time suffered incomparably worse than we.
And there's nothing to do but to go on and on and on and
to keep going with the stoutest hearts we can keep up till
the end do at last come. But the Germans now (as the
rest of us) are fighting for their lives. They are desperate
and their leaders care nothing for human life.</p>

<p>The Embassy now is a good deal bigger than the whole
State Department ever was in times of peace. I have
three buildings for offices, and a part of our civil force occupies
two other buildings. Even a general supervision
of so large a force is in itself a pretty big job. The army
and the Navy have each about the same space as the Embassy
proper. Besides, our people have huts and inns and
clubs and hospitals all over the town. Even though there
be fewer vexing problems than there were while we were
neutral, there is not less work&mdash;on the contrary, more.
Nor will there be an end to it for a very long time&mdash;long
after my time here. The settling of the war and the beginning
of peace activities, whenever these come, will involve
a great volume of work. But I've no ambition to
have these things in hand. As soon as a natural time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-380" id="page2-380"></a>[pg II-380]</span>
relief shall come, I'll go and be happier in my going than
you or anybody else can guess.</p>

<p>Now we go to get my digestion stiffened up for another
long tug&mdash;unless the Germans proceed forthwith to knock
us out&mdash;which they cannot do.</p>

<p>With my love to everybody on the Hill,</p></div>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Waldorf Astor&mdash;since become Viscount
and Viscountess Astor&mdash;had offered the Pages the use of
their beautiful seaside house at Sandwich, Kent, and it
was the proposed vacation here to which Page refers in
this letter. He obtained a six weeks' leave of absence and
almost the last letters which Page wrote from England
are dated from this place. These letters have all the
qualities of Page at his best: but the handwriting is a sad
reminder of the change that was progressively taking place
in his physical condition. It is still a clear and beautiful
script, but there are signs of a less steady hand than the
one that had written the vigorous papers of the preceding
four years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>Memorandum</i><br />
<br />
Sandwich, Kent, Sunday, 19 May, 1918.<br />
</div>

<p>We're at Rest Harrow and it's a fine, sunny early
spring Carolina day. The big German drive has evidently
begun its second phase. We hear the guns distinctly.
We see the coast-guard aeroplanes at almost any
time o'day. What is the mood about the big battle?</p>

<p>The soldiers&mdash;British and French&mdash;have confidence in
their ability to hold the Germans back from the Channel
and from Paris. Yet can one rely on the judgment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-381" id="page2-381"></a>[pg II-381]</span>
soldiers? They have the job in hand and of course they
believe in themselves. While one does not like in the
least to discount their judgment and their hopefulness,
for my part I am not <i>quite</i> so sure of their ability to make
sound judgments as I wish I were. The chances are in
favour of their success; but&mdash;suppose they should have to
yield and give up Calais and other Channel ports? Well,
they've prepared for it as best they can. They have made
provision for commandeering most of the hotels in London
that are not yet taken over&mdash;for hospitals for the wounded
now in France.</p>

<p>And the war would take on a new phase. Whatever
should become of the British and American armies, the
Germans would be no nearer having England than they
now are. They would not have command of the sea.
The combined British and American fleets could keep
every German ship off the ocean and continue the blockade
by sea&mdash;indefinitely; and, if the peoples of the two countries
hold fast, a victory would be won at last&mdash;at sea.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR RALPH:</p>

<p>I felt very proud yesterday when I read T.R.'s good
word in the <i>Outlook</i> about your book<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76" /><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. If I had written
what he said myself&mdash;I mean, if I had written what I
think of the book&mdash;I should have said this very thing.
And there is one thing more I should have said, viz.:&mdash;All
your life and all my life, we have cultivated the opinion
at home that we had nothing to do with the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-382" id="page2-382"></a>[pg II-382]</span>
world, nothing to do with Europe in particular&mdash;and in
our political life our hayseed spokesmen have said this
over and over again till many people, perhaps most people,
came really to believe that it was true. Now this aloofness,
this utterly detached attitude, was a pure invention
of the shirt-sleeve statesman at home. I have long concluded,
for other reasons as well as for this, that these men
are the most ignorant men in the whole world; more ignorant&mdash;because
they are viciously ignorant&mdash;than the Negro
boys who act as caddies at Pinehurst; more ignorant than
the inmates of the Morganton Asylum; more ignorant
than sheep or rabbits or idiots. They have been the
chief hindrances of our country&mdash;worse than traitors, in
effect. It is they, in fact, who kept our people ignorant
of the Germans, ignorant of the English, ignorant of our
own history, ignorant of ourselves. Now your book,
without mentioning the subject, shows this important
fact clearly, by showing that our aloofness has all been a
fiction. <i>We've been in the world&mdash;and right in the middle
of the world&mdash;the whole time</i>.</p>

<p>And our public consciousness of this fact has enormously
slipped back. Take Franklin, Madison, Monroe, Jefferson;
take Hay, Root&mdash;and then consider some of our
present representatives! One good result of the war and
of our being in it will be the restoration of our foreign
consciousness. Every one of the half million, or three million,
soldiers who go to France will know more about foreign
affairs than all Congress knew two years ago.</p>

<p>A stay of nearly five years in London (five years ago
to-day I was on the ship coming here) with no absence
long enough to give any real rest, have got my digestion
wrong. I've therefore got a real leave for two months.
Your mother and I have a beautiful house here that has
been lent to us, right on the Channel where there's nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-383" id="page2-383"></a>[pg II-383]</span>
worth bombing and where as much sunshine and warmth
come as come anywhere in England. We got here last
night and to-day is as fine an early spring day as you ever
had in the Sandhills. I shall golf and try to find me an old
horse to ride, and I'll stay out in the sunshine and try to
get the inside machinery going all right. We may have a
few interruptions, but I hope not many, if the Germans
leave us alone. Your mother has got to go to Newcastle to
christen a new British warship&mdash;a compliment the Admiralty
pays her &quot;to bind the two nations closer together&quot;
etc. etc. And I've got to go to Cambridge to receive an
LL.D. for the President. Only such things are allowed
to interrupt us. And we are very much hoping to see
Frank here.</p>

<p>We are in sound of the battle. We hear the big guns
whenever we go outdoors. A few miles down the beach
is a rifle range and we hear the practice there. Almost
any time of day we can hear aeroplanes which (I presume)
belong to the coast guard. There's no danger of
forgetting the war, therefore, unless we become stone
deaf. But this decent air and sunshine are blessings of
the highest kind. I never became so tired of anything
since I had the measles as I've become of London.
My Lord! it sounded last night as if we had jumped from
the frying pan into the fire. Just as we were about to go
to bed the big gun on the beach&mdash;just outside the fence
around our yard&mdash;about 50 yards from the house, began
its thundering belch&mdash;five times in quick succession,
rattling the windows and shaking the very foundation of
things. Then after a pause of a few minutes, another
round of five shots. Then the other guns all along the
beach took up the chorus&mdash;farther off&mdash;and the inland
guns followed. They are planted all the way to London&mdash;ninety
miles. For about two hours we had this roar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-384" id="page2-384"></a>[pg II-384]</span>
and racket. There was an air raid on, and there were
supposed to be twenty-five or thirty German planes on
their way to London. I hear that it was the worst raid
that London has had. Two of them were brought down&mdash;that's
the only good piece of news I've heard about it.
Well, we are not supposed to be in danger. They fly over
us on the way to bigger game. At any rate I'll take the
risk for this air and sunshine. Trenches and barbed wire
run all along the beach&mdash;I suppose to help in case of an
invasion. But an invasion is impossible in my judgment.
Holy Moses! what a world!&mdash;the cannon in the big battle
in France roaring in our ears all the time, this cannon at
our door likely to begin action any night and all the rest
along the beach and on the way to London, and this is
what we call rest! The world is upside down, all crazy,
all murderous; but we've got to stop this barbaric assault,
whatever the cost.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>... I can't get quite to the bottom of the anti-English
feeling at Washington. God knows, this people
have their faults. Their social system and much else here
is medi&aelig;val. I could write several volumes in criticism
of them. So I could also in criticism of anybody else.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-385" id="page2-385"></a>[pg II-385]</span>
But Jefferson's<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77" /><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> letter is as true to-day as it was when he
wrote it. One may or may not have a lot of sentiment
about it; but, without sentiment, it's mere common sense,
mere prudence, the mere instinct of safety to keep close
to Great Britain, to have a decent respect for the good
qualities of these people and of this government. Certainly
it is a mere perversity&mdash;lost time&mdash;lost motion,
lost everything&mdash;to cherish a dislike and a distrust of them&mdash;a
thing that I cannot wholly understand. While we are,
I fear, going to have trade troubles and controversies, my
feeling is, on the whole, in spite of the attitude of our official
life, that an increasing number of our people are
waking up to what England has done and is and may be
depended on to do. Isn't that true?</p>

<p>We've no news here. We see nobody who knows anything.
I am far from strong&mdash;the old stomach got tired
and I must gradually coax it back to work. That's
practically my sole business now for a time, and it's a
slow process. But it's coming along and relief from seeing
hordes of people is as good as medicine.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>Your speeches have a cumulative effect in cheering up
the British. As you see, if you look over the mass of
newspaper clippings that I send to the Department, or
have them looked over, the British press of all parties and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-386" id="page2-386"></a>[pg II-386]</span>
shades of opinion constantly quote them approvingly and
gratefully. They have a cumulative effect, too, in clearing
the atmosphere. Take, for instance, your declaration
in New York about standing by Russia. All the
allied governments in Europe wish to stand by Russia,
but their pressing business with the war, near at hand,
causes them in a way to forget Russia; and certainly the
British public, all intent on the German &quot;drive&quot; in France
had in a sense forgotten Russia. You woke them up.
And your &quot;Why set a limit to the American Army?&quot; has
had a cheering effect. As leader and spokesman of the
enemies of Germany&mdash;by far the best trumpet-call spokesman
and the strongest leader&mdash;your speeches are worth
an army in France and more, for they keep the proper
moral elevation. All this is gratefully recognized here.
Public opinion toward us is wholesome and you have a
&quot;good press&quot; in this Kingdom. In this larger matter, all
is well. The English faults are the failings of the smaller
men&mdash;about smaller matters&mdash;not of the large men nor of
the public, about large matters.</p>

<p>In private, too, thoughtful Englishmen by their fears
pay us high tribute. I hear more and more constantly
such an opinion as this: &quot;You see, when the war is over,
you Americans will have much the largest merchant fleet.
You will have much the largest share of money, and England
and France and all the rest of the world will owe you
money. You will have a large share of essential raw materials.
You will have the machinery for marine insurance
and for foreign banking. You will have much the largest
volume of productive labour. And you will know the
world as you have never known it before. What then is
going to become of British trade?&quot;</p>

<p>The best answer I can give is: &quot;Adopt American
methods of manufacture, and the devil take the hindmost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-387" id="page2-387"></a>[pg II-387]</span>
There will be for a long time plenty for everybody
to do; and let us make sure that we both play the game
fairly: that's the chief matter to look out for.&quot; That's
what I most fear in the decades following the end of the
war&mdash;trade clashes.</p>

<p>The Englishman's pride will be hurt. I recall a speech
made to me by the friendliest of the British&mdash;Mr. Balfour
himself: &quot;I confess that as an Englishman it hurts my
pride to have to borrow so much even from you. But I will
say that I'd rather be in your debt than in anybody else's.&quot;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR HOUSE:</p>

<p>... I can write in the same spirit of the Labour
Group which left for home last week. Nobody has been
here from our side who had a better influence than they.
They emphatically stuck by their instructions and took
pleasure, against the blandishments of certain British
Socialists, in declaring against any meeting with anybody
from the enemy countries to discuss &quot;peace-by-negotiation&quot;
or anything else till the enemy is whipped. They
made admirable speeches and proved admirable representatives
of the bone and sinew of American manhood.
They had dead-earnestness and good-humour and hard
horse-sense.</p>

<p>This sort of visit is all to the good. Great good they
do, too, in the present English curiosity to see and hear
the right sort of frank, candid Americans. Nobody who
hasn't been here lately can form an idea of the eagerness
of all classes to hear and learn about the United States.
There never was, and maybe never will be again, such a
chance to inform the British and&mdash;to help them toward a
rights understanding of the United States and our people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-388" id="page2-388"></a>[pg II-388]</span>
We are not half using the opportunity. There seems to
be a feeling on your side the ocean that we oughtn't to
send men here to &quot;lecture&quot; the British. No typical,
earnest, sound American who has been here has &quot;lectured&quot;
the British. They have all simply told facts and instructed
them and won their gratitude and removed misconceptions.
For instance, I have twenty inquiries a
week about Dr. Buttrick. He went about quietly during
his visit here and talked to university audiences and to
working-men's meetings and he captured and fascinated
every man he met. He simply told them American facts,
explained the American spirit and aims and left a grateful
memory everywhere. Buttrick cost our Government
nothing: he paid his own way. But if he had cost as much
as a regiment it would have been well spent. The people
who heard him, read American utterances, American history,
American news in a new light. And most of his talk
was with little groups of men, much of it even in private
conversation. He did no orating or &quot;lecturing.&quot; A
hundred such men, if we had them, would do more for a
perfect understanding with the British people than anything
else whatsoever could do.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR ARTHUR:</p>

<p>... I do get tired&mdash;my Lord! how tired!&mdash;not of
the work but of the confinement, of the useless things I
have to spend time on, of the bad digestion that has overtaken
me, of London, of the weather, of absence from you
all&mdash;of the general breaking up of the world, of this mad
slaughter of men. But, after all, this is the common lot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-389" id="page2-389"></a>[pg II-389]</span>
now and I am grateful for a chance to do what I can.
That's the true way to look at it.</p>

<p>... Worry? I don't worry about anything except
the war in general and this mad world so threatened by
these devil barbarians. And I have a feeling that, when
we get a few thousand flying machines, we'll put an end
to that, alas! with the loss of many of our brave boys. I
hear the guns across the channel as I write&mdash;an unceasing
boom! boom! boom! That's what takes the stuff out of
me and gets my inside machinery wrong. Still, I'm gradually
getting even that back to normal. Golf and the
poets are fine medicine. I read Keats the other day, with
entire forgetfulness of the guns. Here we have a comfortable
house, our own servants (as many as we need), a
beautiful calm sea, a perfect air and for the present ideal
weather. There's nobody down here but Scottish soldiers.
We've struck up a pleasant acquaintance with
them; and some of the fellows from the Embassy come
down week ends. Only the murderous guns keep their
eternal roar.</p>

<p>Thanks, thanks, a thousand thanks, old man. It'll all
work out right.</p>

<p>... I look at it in this way: all's well that ends well.
We are now doing our duty. That's enough. These
things don't bother me, because doing our duty now is
worth a million years of past errors and shortcomings.</p>

<i>To Ralph W. Page</i><br />
<br />
Rest Harrow, Sandwich, Kent.<br />
June 7, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR RALPH:</p>

<p>... I have all along cherished an expectation of
two things&mdash;(1) That when we did get an American Army
by conscription, if it should remain at war long enough to
learn the game, it would become the best army that the
world ever saw, for the simple reason that its ranks would
contain more capable men than any other country has
ever produced. The proof of this comes at once. Even
our new and raw troops have astonished the veterans of
the French and British armies and (I have no doubt) of
the German Army also. It'll be our men who will whip
the Germans, and there are nobody else's men who could
do it. We've already saved the Entente from collapse
by our money. We'll save the day again by our fighting
men. That is to say, we'll save the world, thank God; and
I fear it couldn't have been saved in any other way. (2)
Since the people by their mood command and compel
efficiency, the most efficient people will at last (as recent
events show) get at the concrete jobs, in spite of anybody's
preferences or philosophy. And this seems at last
to be taking place. What we have suffered and shall
suffer is not failure but delays and delays and bunglings.
But they've got to end by the sheer pressure of the people's
earnestness. These two things, then, are all to the good.</p>

<p>I get the morning papers here at noon. And to-day I
am all alone. Your mother went early on her journey
to launch a British battleship. I haven't had a soul to
speak to all day but my servants. At noon, therefore, I
was rather eager for the papers. I saw at a glance that
a submarine is at work off the New Jersey coast! It's an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-391" id="page2-391"></a>[pg II-391]</span>
awful thing for the innocent victims, to be drowned. But
their deaths have done us a greater service than 100 times as
many lives lost in battle. If anybody lacked earnestness
about the war, I venture to guess that he doesn't lack it any
longer. If the fools would now only shell some innocent
town on the coast, the journey to Berlin would be shortened.</p>

<p>If the Germans had practised a chivalrous humanity in
their war for conquest, they'd have won it. Nothing on
earth can now save them; for the world isn't big enough to
hold them and civilized people. Nor is there any room
for pacifists till this grim business is done.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Affectionately,<br />
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<p>The last piece of writing from Sandwich is the following
memorandum:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
Sandwich, Kent.<br />
June 10, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Germans continue to gain ground in France&mdash;more
slowly, but still they gain. The French and British papers
now give space to plans for the final defense&mdash;the desperate
defense&mdash;of Paris. The Germans are only forty
miles away. Slocum, military attach&eacute;, thinks they will
get it and he reports the same opinion at the War Office&mdash;because
the Germans have taken such a large number of
guns and so much ammunition. Some of these guns were
meant for the American troops, and they cannot now be
replaced in time if the German advance continues. But
I do not know enough facts at first hand to form an opinion.
But, if Paris be taken, the war will go on a long time&mdash;unless
the English-speaking rulers make a compromise.
And, then, in another form&mdash;and forms&mdash;it'll go on indefinitely.&mdash;There
has been no more perilous or uncertain
or anxious time than now.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-392" id="page2-392"></a>[pg II-392]</span>
<p>The United States too late, too late, too late: what if it
should turn out so?</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But it did not turn out so. Even while Page was penning
these lines great events were taking place in France
and the American troops were having a large share in
them. In June the Americans stopped the German
troops at Belleau Wood&mdash;a battle which proved the mettle
of these fresh levies not only for the benefit of the Germans
but of the Allies as well. Thus Page had the great satisfaction
of returning to London while the city was ringing
with the praise of these achievements. He found that
the atmosphere had materially changed since he had last
been in the British capital; when he had left for Sandwich
there had been a general expectation that the Germans
would get Paris or the Channel ports; now, however, there
was every confidence of victory. Greatly as Page rejoiced
over the new prospect, however, the fight at
Belleau Wood brought him his last great sorrow. His
nephew, Allison M. Page, of Aberdeen, North Carolina,
the son of his youngest brother, Frank, lost his life in that
engagement. At first the young man was reported
&quot;missing&quot;; the investigation set afoot by the Ambassador
for some time brought no definite information. One of
the most pathetic of Page's papers is a brief note addressed
by him to Allison Page, asking him for news: &quot;It's been
a long time since we heard from you,&quot; Page wrote his
nephew. &quot;Write how it goes with you. Affectionately,
Uncle Wat.&quot; After travelling over a considerable
part of France, this note found its way back to the Embassy.
The boy&mdash;he was only 19&mdash;had been killed in
action near Belleau Wood, on June 25th, while leading
his detachment in an attack on a machine gun. Citations
and decorations for gallantry in action were given posthumously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-393" id="page2-393"></a>[pg II-393]</span>
by General Pershing, Marshal P&eacute;tain, Major-General
Omar Bundy, and Major-General John A. LeJeune.</p>

<p>And now the shadows began to close in rapidly on
Page. In early July Major Frank C. Page, the Ambassador's
youngest son, came over from France. A brief
glance at his father convinced him that he was dying.
By this time the Ambassador had ceased to go to the Chancery,
but was transacting the most imperative business
propped up in a chair at home. His mind was possessed
by two yearnings: one was to remain in London until
the end of the war, the other was to get back to his
childhood home in North Carolina. Young Page urged
his father to resign, but the weary invalid insisted on
sticking to his post. On this point it seemed impossible
to move him. Knowing that his brother Arthur had
great influence with his father, Frank Page cabled, asking
him to come to England immediately. Arthur took the
first boat, reaching London late in July.</p>

<p>The Ambassador's two sons then gently pressed upon
their father the fact that he must resign. Weak as he
was, the Ambassador was still obdurate.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;It's quitting on the job. I must see
the war through. I can't quit until it's over.&quot;</p>

<p>But Sir William Osler, Page's physician and devoted
friend, exercised his professional authority and insisted on
the resignation. Finally Page consented.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</p>

<p>I have been struggling for a number of months against
the necessity to write you this note; for my doctors now
advise me to give up all work for a period&mdash;my London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-394" id="page2-394"></a>[pg II-394]</span>
doctor says for six months. I have a progressive digestive
trouble which does not yield to the usual treatment. It's
the war, five London winters, and the unceasing labour
which is now the common lot. I am ashamed to say that
these have brought me to something near a breakdown.
I have had Sir William Osler as well as two distinguished
London physicians for several months. The digestive
trouble has brought other ills in its train; and I am assured
that they will yield to freedom from responsibility and
complete rest for a time in a dry, warm climate and that
they are not likely to yield to anything else.</p>

<p>I see nothing else to do then but to bow to the inevitable
and to ask you to be kind enough to relieve me and to accept
my resignation to take effect as soon as I can go to
Washington and make a somewhat extended report on
the work here, which, I hope, will be of some use to the
Department; and I ought to go as soon as possible&mdash;say,
in September. I cannot tell you how great my disappointment
is that this request has become necessary.</p>

<p>If the world and its work were so organized that we
could do what we should like to do, I should like a leave
of absence till winter be broken and then to take up my
duties here again till the war end. But that, of course, is
impracticable. And it is now a better time to change
Ambassadors than at any time since the war began. My
five years' service has had two main phases&mdash;the difficult
period of our neutrality and the far easier period since we
came into the war. But when the war ends, I fear that
there will be again more or less troublesome tasks arising
out of commercial difficulties.</p>

<p>But for any reasonable period the Embassy's work fortunately
can now go on perfectly well with Mr. Laughlin
as Charg&eacute;&mdash;until my successor can get here. The Foreign
Office like him, he is <i>persona grata</i> to all other Departments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-395" id="page2-395"></a>[pg II-395]</span>
of the Government, and he has had a long experience; and
he is most conscientious and capable. And the organization
is in excellent condition.</p>

<p>I venture to ask you to have a cable message sent to me
(to be deciphered by me alone). It will require quite a
little time to pack up and to get away.</p>

<p>I send this, Mr. President, with more regret than I can
express and only after a struggle of more than six months
to avoid it.</p></div>

<br />
Duff House, Banff, Scotland.<br />
Sunday, September 2, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR:</p>

<p>... I've put the period of our life in London, in my
mind, as closed. That epoch is ended. And I am glad.
It was time it ended. My job (<i>that</i> job) is done. From
the letters that Shoecraft has sent me and from what the
papers say, I think I couldn't have ended it more happily&mdash;or
at a better time. I find myself thinking of the winter
down South&mdash;of a Thanksgiving Day dinner for the older
folks of our family, of a Christmas tree for the kids, of
frolics of all sorts, of Rest, of some writing (perhaps not
much), going over my papers with Ralph&mdash;that's what he
wants, you know; etc., etc., etc.&mdash;</p>

<p>And I've got to eat more. I myself come into my thinking
and planning in only two ways&mdash;(1) I'm going to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-396" id="page2-396"></a>[pg II-396]</span>
a suit like old Lord N.'s and (2) I'm going to get all the
good things to eat that there are!</p>

<p>Meantime, my dear, how are you? Don't you let this
getting ready wear you out. Let something go undone
rather. Work Miss Latimer and the boys and the moving
and packing men, and Petherick and the servants.
Take it very easy yourself.</p>

<p>Nine and a half more days here&mdash;may they speed swiftly.
Comfortable as I am, I'm mortal tired of being away from
you&mdash;dead tired.</p>

<p>Praise God it's only 9-1/2 days. If it were 9-3/4, I should
not stand it, but break for home prematurely.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours, dear Allie, with all my love,<br />
W.H.P.<br />
</div>

<p>On August 24th came the President's reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have received your communication of August 1st. It
caused me great regret that the condition of your health
makes it necessary for you to resign. Under the circumstances
I do not feel I have the right to insist on such a
sacrifice as your remaining in London. Your resignation
is therefore accepted. As you request it will take effect
when you report to Washington. Accept my congratulations
that you have no reason to fear a permanent impairment
of your health and that you can resign knowing
that you have performed your difficult duties with distinguished
success.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
WOODROW WILSON.<br />
</div>

<p>The news of Page's resignation inspired tributes from
the British press and from British public men such as have
been bestowed upon few Americans. The London <i>Times</i>
headed its leader &quot;A Great Ambassador&quot; and this note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-397" id="page2-397"></a>[pg II-397]</span>
was echoed in all sections of Great Britain. The part of
Page's career which Englishmen chiefly recalled was his
attitude during the period of neutrality. This, the newspapers
declared, was Page's great contribution to the cause.
The fact that it had had such far-reaching influences on history
was the one especially insisted on. His conciliatory
and skillful behaviour had kept the United States and Great
Britain friends at a time when a less tactful ambassador
might easily have made them enemies; the result was that,
when the time came, the United States could join forces
against the common enemy, with results that were then
daily unfolding on the battlefields of France. &quot;I really
believe,&quot; wrote the Marquess of Crewe, &quot;that there were
several occasions when we might have made it finally impossible
for America to join us in the war; that these
passed by may have been partly due to some glimmering
of common sense on our part, with Grey as its main exponent;
but it was more largely owing to your patience and
courtesy and to the certainty which the Foreign Office
always enjoyed that its action would be set before the
Secretary of State in as favourable a light as it conscientiously
could be.&quot; That, then, was Page's contribution to
the statesmanship of this crisis&mdash;that of holding the two
countries together so that, when the time came, the
United States could join the Allies. A mass of private
letters, all breathing the same sentiment, began to pour in
on Page. There was hardly an illustrious name in Great

the Post of Ambassador and the cause of this step fill me

days of peace and of war your influence has done much to
strengthen the ties of friendship and good-will which
unite the two English-speaking nations of the world. I

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR AMBASSADOR:</p>

<p>It is with the deepest regret that my colleagues and I
have received the news that you have been forced by ill
health to resign your office and that the President has
consented to your relinquishing your ambassadorial
duties. We are sorry that you are leaving us, all the more
because your tenure of office has coincided with one of the
greatest epochs in the history of our two countries and
of the world, and because your influence and counsel
throughout this difficult time have been of the utmost
value to us all.</p>

<p>The power for good or evil which can be exerted by the
occupant of your high position is at all times necessarily
very great. That our peoples are now fighting side by
side in the cause of human freedom and that they are
manifesting an ever growing feeling of cordiality to one
another is largely attributable to the exceptional wisdom
and good-will with which you have discharged your duties.
For the part you have played during the past five years in
bringing about this happy result we owe you our lasting
gratitude.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-399" id="page2-399"></a>[pg II-399]</span>
<p>May I add that while you have always firmly presented
the point of view of your own country, you have succeeded
in winning, not only the respect and admiration of official
circles, but the confidence, and I can say without hesitation,
the affection of all sections of our people? It will be
with universal regret that they will learn that, owing to
the strain of the great responsibilities you have borne,
you are no longer to remain among us. I earnestly
trust that a well-earned rest will speedily restore you to
complete health, and that you have many years of public
service still in store for you.</p>

<p>I should like also to say how much we shall miss Mrs.
Page. She has won a real place in all our hearts. Through
her unfailing tact, her genuine kindliness, and her unvarying
readiness to respond to any call upon her time and
energy, she has greatly contributed to the success of your
ambassadorship.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DEAR MR. PAGE:</p>

<p>I have been out of touch with current events for a few
days, but yesterday I read the two articles in the <i>Times</i>
on your retirement. I am very grieved to think that you
are going. There was not a word of eulogy in the <i>Times</i>
articles that was not under rather than over-stated, and
reflecting thus I thought how rare it is in public life to have
an occasion that justifies the best that can be said. But it
is so now, and I am filled with deep regret that you are
going and with deep gratitude that you came to us and
were here when the war broke out and subsequently. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-400" id="page2-400"></a>[pg II-400]</span>
the United States had been represented here by any one
less decided as to the right and wrong of the war and less
firm and courageous than yourself, the whole of the relations
between your country and ours would have been
in peril. And if the two countries had gone apart instead
of coming together the whole fate of the world would be
very different from what I hope it will now be.</p>

<p>I have often thought that the forces behind public
affairs are so tremendous that individuals have little real,
even when much apparent, influence upon the course of
events. But in the early years of the war I think everything
might have gone wrong if it had not been that certain
men of strong moral conviction were in certain places.
And you were pre&euml;minently one of these. President
Wilson I am sure was another, though I know him only
through you and Colonel House and his own public utterances.
Even so your influence must have counted in his
action, by your friendship with him as well as by the fact
of your being the channel through which communications
passed between him and us.</p>

<p>I cannot adequately express what it was to me personally
in the dark days of 1914, 1915, and 1916 to know
how you felt about the great issues involved in the war.</p>

<p>I go to Fallodon at the end of this week and come to
London the first week of September&mdash;if you and Mrs.
Page have not left by then I hope I may see you. I long
to do so before you go. I wish you may recover perfect
health. My eyesight continues to fail and I shall soon
be absolutely dependent upon other eyes for reading
print. Otherwise I feel as well as a schoolboy, but it is
depressing to be so well and yet so crippled in sight.</p>

<p>Please do not trouble to answer this letter&mdash;you must
have too many letters of the kind to be able to reply to
them separately&mdash;but if there is a chance of my seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-401" id="page2-401"></a>[pg II-401]</span>
you before you go please let me have a message to say
when and where.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Yours sincerely,<br />
GREY OF F.<br />
</div>

<p>A few months before his resignation Page had received
a letter from Theodore Roosevelt, who was more familiar
than most Americans with Page's work in London. This
summed up what will be probably the judgment of history
upon his ambassadorship. The letter was in reply to one
written to the Ex-President, asking him to show hospitality
to the Archbishop of York<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78" /><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, who was about to visit the
United States.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
(Office of the Metropolitan Magazine)<br />

March 1st, 1918.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MY DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR:</p>

<p>I am very much pleased with your letter, and as soon
as the Archbishop arrives, he will be addressed by me
with all his titles, and I will get him to lunch with me or
dine with me, or do anything else he wishes! I shall do it
for his own sake, and still more, my dear fellow, I shall do
it for the sake of the Ambassador who has represented
America in London during these trying years as no other
Ambassador in London has ever represented us, with the
exception of Charles Francis Adams, during the Civil
War.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Faithfully yours,<br />
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.<br />
</div>

<p>The seriousness of Page's condition was not understood
in London; consequently there were many attempts to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-402" id="page2-402"></a>[pg II-402]</span>
him honour in which he was unable to participate. Custom
demands that a retiring Ambassador shall go to
Windsor Castle to dine and to sleep; but King George,
who was very solicitous about Page's health, offered to
spare the Ambassador this trip and to come himself to
London for this leave-taking. However, Page insisted on
carrying out the usual programme; but the visit greatly
tired him and he found it impossible personally to take
part in any further official farewells. The last ceremony
was a visit from the Lord Mayor and Council of Plymouth,
who came to the Ambassador's house in September to present
the freedom of the city. Ever since Page's speech of
August 4, 1917, Plymouth had been planning to do him this
honour; when the Council heard that the Ambassador's
health would make it impossible for him to visit Plymouth,
they asked if they might not come to London. The proceeding
was most impressive and touching and the Ambassador's
five-minute speech, the last one which he made in
England, had all his old earnestness and mental power,
though the physical weakness of the man saddened everybody
present. The Lord Mayor presented the freedom
of the ancient borough in a temporary holder, explaining
that a more permanent receptacle would follow the Ambassador
to America. When this arrived, it proved to be
a beautiful silver model of the <i>Mayflower</i>. Certainly
there could have been no more appropriate farewell gift
to Page from the English town whose name so closely
links the old country with the United States.</p>

<p>The last scene took place at Waterloo Station. Sir
Arthur Walsh came representing the King, while Mr.
Balfour, Lord Robert Cecil, and other ministers represented
the cabinet. The Government had provided a
special railway carriage, and this was stationed at a convenient
place as Page's motor drew up. So weak was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-403" id="page2-403"></a>[pg II-403]</span>
the Ambassador that it was with difficulty that his companions,
the ever devoted Mr. Laughlin, on one side, and
Page's secretary, Mr. Shoecraft, on the other, succeeded
in supporting him to his chair. Mr. Balfour, Lord Robert
Cecil and the others then entered the carriage, and,
with all that sympathetic dignity in which Englishmen
of this type excel, said a few gracious and affectionate
words of good-bye. They all stood, with uncovered heads,
as the train slowly pulled out of the station, and caught
their final glimpse of Page as he smiled at them and
faintly waved his hand.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Perhaps the man most affected by this leave-taking was
Mr. Balfour. He knew, as did the others, that that frail
and emaciated figure had been one of the greatest friends
that Britain had had at the most dreadful crisis in her
history. He has many times told of this parting scene
at Waterloo Station and always with emotion.</p>

<p>&quot;I loved that man,&quot; he once said to an American friend,
recalling this event. &quot;I almost wept when he left England.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII" />CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE END</h3>


<p>Page came home only to die. In fact, at one
time it seemed improbable that he would live to
reach the United States. The voyage of the <i>Olympic</i>, on
which he sailed, was literally a race with death. The
great-hearted Captain, Sir Bertram Hayes, hearing of the
Ambassador's yearning to reach his North Carolina home,
put the highest pressure upon his ship, which almost
leaped through the waves. But for a considerable part of
the trip Page was too ill to have much consciousness of his
surroundings. At times he was delirious; once more he
lived over the long period of &quot;neutrality&quot;; again he was
discussing intercepted cargoes and &quot;notes&quot; with Sir
Edward Grey; from this his mind would revert to his
English literary friends, and then again he was a boy in
North Carolina. The <i>Olympic</i> reached New York more
than a day ahead of schedule; Page was carried down the
gangplank on a stretcher, propped up with pillows; and
since he was too weak then to be taken to his Southern
home, he was placed temporarily in St. Luke's Hospital.
Page arrived on a beautiful sunshiny October day; Fifth
Avenue had changed its name in honour of the new Liberty
Loan and had become the &quot;Avenue of the Allies&quot;; each
block, from Forty-second Street north, was decorated with
the colours of one of the nations engaged in the battle
against Germany; the street was full of Red Cross workers
and other picturesquely clad enthusiasts selling Liberty
Bonds; in its animated beauty and in its inspiring significance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-405" id="page2-405"></a>[pg II-405]</span>
it formed an appropriate setting for Page's homecoming.</p>

<p>The American air seemed to act like a tonic on Page;
in a short time he showed such improvement that his recovery
seemed not impossible. So far as his spirits and
his mind were concerned, he became his old familiar self.
He was able to see several of his old friends, he read
the newspapers and discussed the international situation
with his customary liveliness. With the assistance of
his daughter, Mrs. Loring, he even kept track of his
correspondence. Evidently the serious nature of his
illness was not understood, for invitations to speak
poured in from all quarters. Most of these letters Mrs.
Loring answered, but there was one that Page insisted
on attending to himself. The City of Cleveland was
organizing some kind of a meeting dedicated to closer relations
with Great Britain, and the Mayor wrote Page asking
him to speak. The last thing which Page wrote with
his own hand was his reply to this invitation; and it is an
impressive fact that his final written word should have dealt
with the subject that had been so close to his heart for the
preceding five years.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>To Harry L. Davis, Mayor of Cleveland, Ohio</i></p>

<p>I deeply regret my health will not permit me to attend
any public function for some time to come; for I deeply
appreciate your invitation on behalf of the City of Cleveland
for the meeting on December 7th, and have a profound
sympathy with its purpose to bring the two great
English-speaking worlds as close together as possible,
so that each shall thoroughly understand the courage
and sacrifice and ideals of the other. This is the greatest
political task of the future. For such a complete and
lasting understanding is the only basis for the continued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-406" id="page2-406"></a>[pg II-406]</span>
progress of civilization. I am proud to be associated in
your thought, Mr. Mayor, with so fitting and happy an occasion,
and only physical inability could cause absence.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
Sincerely,<br />
WALTER H. PAGE.<br />
</div>

<p>Page's improvement was only temporary; a day or two
after this letter was written he began to sink rapidly; it
was therefore decided to grant his strongest wish and take
him to North Carolina. He arrived in Pinehurst on
December 12th, so weak that his son Frank had to carry
him in his arms from the train.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Frank,&quot; said Page, with a slightly triumphant
smile, &quot;I did get here after all, didn't I?&quot;</p>

<p>He lingered for a few days and died, at eight o'clock in
the evening, on December 21st, in his sixty-fourth year.
He suffered no pain. He was buried in the Page family
plot in the Bethesda Cemetery near Aberdeen.</p>

<p>He was as much of a war casualty as was his nephew
Allison Page, who lost his life with his face to the German
machine guns in Belleau Wood.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX" />APPENDIX</h2>

<p>SCRAPS FROM UNFINISHED DIARIES</p>


<p>Page was not methodical in keeping diaries. His
documents, however, reveal that he took many
praiseworthy resolutions in this direction. They include
a large number of bulky books, each labelled &quot;Diary&quot;
and inscribed with the year whose events were to be recorded.
The outlook is a promising one; but when the
books are opened they reveal only fragmentary good intentions.
Entries are kept up for a few days, and then
the work comes to an end. These volumes contain many
scraps of interesting writing, however, which are worth
preserving; some of them are herewith presented in haphazard
fashion, with no attempt at order in subject matter.</p>


<p>1913</p>

<p>PETHERICK</p>

<p>Petherick: may he be immortal; for he is a man
who has made of a humble task a high calling; and
without knowing it he has caused a man of a high calling
to degrade it to a mean level. Now Petherick is a humble
Englishman, whose father many years ago enjoyed the
distinction of carrying the mail pouch to and from the
post office for the American Embassy in London. As
father, so son. Petherick succeeded Petherick. In this
remote period (<i>the</i> Petherick must now be 60) Governments
had &quot;despatch agents,&quot; men who distributed mail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-408" id="page2-408"></a>[pg II-408]</span>
and whatnot, sent it on from capital to capital&mdash;were
a sort of general &quot;forwarding&quot; factotums. The office
is really out of date now. Telegraph companies, express
companies, railway companies, the excellent mail service
and the like out-despatch any conceivable agent&mdash;except
Petherick. Petherick has qualities that defy change,
such as an unfailing courtesy, a genuine joy in serving
his fellows, the very genius of helpfulness. Well, since a
governmental office once established acquires qualities
of perpetuity, three United States despatch agents have
survived the development of modern communication, one
in London, one in New York, and the third (I think) in
San Francisco. At any rate, the London agent remains.</p>

<p>Now in the beginning the London despatch agent was a
mail messenger (as I understand) for the Embassy. He
still takes the pouch to the post office, and brings it back.
In ordinary times, that's all he does for the Embassy, for
which his salary of about &mdash;&mdash; is paid by the State Department&mdash;too
high a salary for the labour done, but none
too high for the trustworthy qualities required. If this
had been all that Petherick did, he would probably have
long ago gone to the scrap heap. It is one mark of a man
of genius that he always makes his job. So Petherick.
The American Navy came into being and parts of it come
to this side of the world. Naval officers need help when
they come ashore. Petherick was always on hand with
despatches and mail for them, and Petherick was a handy
man. Did the Captain want a cab? Petherick had one
waiting. Did the Captain want rooms? Such-and-such
a hotel was the proper one for him. Rooms were engaged.
Did the Captain's wife need a maid? Petherick had
thought of that, too. Then a Secretary from some continental
legation wished to know a good London tailor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-409" id="page2-409"></a>[pg II-409]</span>
He sought Petherick. An American Ambassador from
the continent came to London. London yielded Petherick
for his guidance and his wants. Petherick became omni-present,
universally useful&mdash;an American institution in
fact. A naval officer who had been in Asiatic waters was
steaming westward to the Mediterranean. His wife and
three babies came to London, where she was to meet her
husband, who was to spend several weeks here. A telegram
to Petherick: they needed to do nothing else. When
the lady arrived a furnished flat, a maid and a nurse and
a cook and toys awaited her. When her husband arrived,
a pair of boots awaited him from the same last that his
last pair had been made on, in London, five years before.
At some thoughtful moment $1,000 was added
to Petherick's salary by the Navy Department; and a
few years ago a handsome present was made to Petherick
by the United States Naval Officers all over the
world.</p>

<p>But Petherick, with all his virtues, is merely an Englishman,
and it is not usual for an Englishman to hold a
$3,000 office under appointment from the United States
Government. The office of despatch agent, therefore,
has been nominally held by an American citizen in
London. This American citizen for a good many years
has been Mr. Crane, a barrister, who simply turns over
the salary to Petherick; and all the world, except the
Secretary of State, knows that Petherick is Petherick and
there is none other but him.</p>

<p>Now comes the story: Mr. Bryan, looking around the
world for offices for his henchmen, finds that one Crane
has been despatch agent in London for many years, and
he writes me a personal and confidential letter, asking
if this be not a good office for some Democrat!</p>

<p>I tell the story to the Naval Attach&eacute;! He becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-410" id="page2-410"></a>[pg II-410]</span>
riotous. He'll have to employ half a dozen clerks to do
for the Navy ill what Petherick does well with ease, if he's
removed. Life would not be worth living anyhow. I
uncover Petherick to the Secretary and show him in his
glory. It must be said to the Secretary's credit that he
has said nothing more about it. Petherick, let us hope,
will live forever. The Secretary's petty-spoils mind now
works on grand plans for Peace, holy Peace, having unsuccessfully
attacked poor Petherick. And Petherick
knows nothing about it and never dreams of an enemy in
all the world, and in all naval and diplomatic life he has
only fast friends. If Mr. Bryan had removed him, he
might have made a temporary friend of one Democrat
from Oklahoma, and lasting enemies of all that Democrat's
rivals and of the whole naval and diplomatic service.</p>


<p><i>November, 1914.</i></p>

<p>We have to get away from it&mdash;or try to&mdash;a minute at a
time; and the comic gods sometimes help us. Squier<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79" /><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> has
a junior officer here to hold his desk down when he's gone.
He's a West Point Lieutenant with a German name.
His study is ordnance. A new kind of bomb gives him
the same sort of joy that a new species would have given
Darwin. He was over in France&mdash;where the armies had
passed to and from Paris&mdash;and one day he found an unexploded
German bomb of a new sort. The thing weighed
half a ton or thereabouts, and it was loaded. Somehow
he got it to London&mdash;I never did hear how. He wrapped
it in blankets and put it under his bed. He went out of
town to study some other infernal contraption and the
police found this thing under his bed. The War Office
took it and began to look for him&mdash;to shoot him, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-411" id="page2-411"></a>[pg II-411]</span>
bomb-harbouring German! They soon discovered, of
course, that he was one of our men and an officer in the
United States Army. Then I heard of it for the first
time. Here came a profuse letter of apology from the
Government; they had not known the owner was one of
my attach&eacute;s. Pardon, pardon&mdash;a thousand apologies.
But while this letter was being delivered to me one of the
under-secretaries of the Government was asking one of
our secretaries, &quot;In Heaven's name, what's the Ambassador
going to do about it? We have no right to molest
the property of one of your attach&eacute;s, but this man's room
is less than 100 yards from Westminster Abbey: it might
blow up half of London. We can't give the thing back
to him!&quot; They had taken it to the Duck Pond, wherever
that is. About that time the Lieutenant came back.
His pet bomb gone&mdash;what was I going to do about it?</p>

<p>The fellow actually wanted to bring it to his office in
the Embassy!</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Lieutenant, besides the possibility of blow-up
this building and killing every mother's son of us, consider
the scandal of the American Embassy in London
blown up by a German bomb. That would go down in
the school histories of the United States. Don't you see?&quot;
No, he didn't see instantly&mdash;he does so love a bomb! I
had to threaten to disown him and let him be shot before
he was content to go and tell them to unload it&mdash;he <i>would</i>
have it, unloaded, if not loaded.</p>

<p>Well, I had to write half a dozen letters before the thing
was done for. He thinks me a chicken-livered old coward
and I know much more about him than I knew before;
and we are at peace. The newspapers never got the
story, but his friends about town still laugh at him for
trying first to blow up Westminster Abbey and then his
own Ambassador. He was at my house at dinner the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-412" id="page2-412"></a>[pg II-412]</span>
other night and one of the ladies asked him: &quot;Lieutenant,
have you any darling little pet lyddite cartridges in your
pocket?&quot; Think of a young fellow who just loves bombs!
Has loaded bombs for pets! How I misspent my youth!</p>


<p><i>February, 1915.</i></p>

<p>This is among the day's stories: The British took a ship
that had a cargo of 100,000 busts of Von Hindenburg&mdash;filled
with copper.</p>

<p>Another: When Frederick Watts was painting Lord
Minto he found it hard to make the portrait please him.
When he was told that Lord Minto liked it and Lady
Minto didn't and that So-and-So praised it, he exclaimed:
&quot;I don't care a d&mdash;n what anyone thinks about it&mdash;except
a fellow named Sargent.&quot;</p>

<p>And the King said (about the wedding<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80" /><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>): &quot;I have the
regulation of the dress to be worn at all functions in the
Chapel Royal. I, therefore, declare that the American
Ambassador may have any dress worn that he pleases!&quot;</p>

<p>E.M. House went to Paris this morning, having no
peace message from this Kingdom whatever. This kind
of talk here now was spoken of by the Prime Minister the
other day &quot;as the twittering of a sparrow in a tumult
that shakes the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Lady P. remarked to me to-day, as many persons do,
that I am very fortunate to be Ambassador here at this
particular time. Perhaps; but it isn't easy to point out
precisely wherein the good fortune consists. This much
is certain: it is surely a hazardous occupation now. Henry
James remarked, too, that nobody could afford to miss
the experience of being here&mdash;nobody who could be here.
Perhaps true, again; but I confess to enough shock and
horror to keep me from being so very sure of that. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-413" id="page2-413"></a>[pg II-413]</span>
no other phenomenon is more noticeable than the wish
of every sort of an American to be here. I sometimes
wonder whether the really well-balanced American does.
Most of them are of the overwrought and excitable kinds.</p>

<p>A conservative lady, quite conscientious, was taken
down to dinner by Winston Churchill. Said she, to be
quite frank and fair: &quot;Mr. Churchill, I must tell you that
I don't like your politics. Yet we must get on together.
You may say, if you like, that this is merely a matter of
personal taste with me, as I might not like your&mdash;well,
your moustache.&quot; &quot;I see no reason, Madam, why you
should come in contact with either.&quot;</p>

<p>My talk with Bonar Law: He was disposed to believe
that if England had declared at once that she would go
to war with Germany if France was attacked, there would
have been no war. Well, would English opinion, before
Belgium was attacked, have supported a government
which made such a declaration?</p>

<p>Mr. Bonar Law thinks that President Wilson ought to
have protested about Belgium.</p>

<p>He didn't agree with me that much good human material
goes to waste in this Kingdom for lack of opportunity.
(That's the Conservative in him.)</p>


<p><i>Friday, April 30, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey came to tea to talk with Mr. House
and me&mdash;little talk of the main subject (peace), which is
not yet ripe by a great deal. Sir Edward said the Germans
had poisoned wells in South Africa. They have
lately used deadly gases in France. The key to their mind
says Sir Edward, is this&mdash;they attribute to other folk
what they are thinking of doing themselves.</p>

<p>While Sir Edward was here John Sargent came in and
brought Katharine the charcoal portrait of her that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-414" id="page2-414"></a>[pg II-414]</span>
had made&mdash;his present to her for her and Chud to give
to W.A.W.P.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81" /><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and me. A very graceful and beautiful
thing for him to do.</p>


<p><i>April 30, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Concerning Peace: The German civil authorities want
peace and so does one faction of the military party.
But how can they save their face? They have made
their people believe that they are at once the persecuted
and the victorious. If they stop, how can
they explain their stopping? The people might rend
them. The ingenious loophole discovered by House is&mdash;mere
moonshine, viz., the freedom of the seas in war.
That is a one-sided proposition unless they couple with
it the freedom of the land in war also, which is nonsense.
Nothing can be done, then, until some unfavourable military
event brings a new mind to the Germans. Peace
talk, therefore, is yet mere moonshine. House has been
to Berlin, from London, thence to Paris, then back to
London again&mdash;from Nowhere (as far as peace is concerned)
to Nowhere again.</p>


<p><i>May 3, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Why doesn't the President make himself more accessible?
Dismiss X and get a bigger man? Take his cabinet
members really into his confidence? Everybody who
comes here makes these complaints of him!</p>

<p>We dined to-night at Y's. Professor M. was there, etc.
He says we've got to have polygamy in Europe after the
war to keep the race up.</p>


<p><i>Friday, May 21, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Last night the Italian Parliament voted to give the
Government war-powers; and this means immediate war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-415" id="page2-415"></a>[pg II-415]</span>
on the side of the Allies. There are now eight nations
fighting against Germany, Austria, and Turkey; viz.,
Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Japan, Belgium,
Serbia, Montenegro. And it looks much as if the United
States will be forced in by Germany.</p>

<p>The British Government is wrestling with a very grave
internal disruption&mdash;to make a Coalition Government.
The only portfolios that seem absolutely secure are the
Prime Minister's and the Foreign Secretary's (Sir Edward
Grey's)&mdash;for which latter, many thanks. The two-fold
trouble is&mdash;(1) a difference between Churchill (First Lord
of the Admiralty) and Lord Fisher&mdash;about the Dardanelles
campaign and (I dare say) other things, and (2) Lord
Kitchener's failure to secure ammunition&mdash;&quot;to organize
the industries of the Kingdom.&quot; Some even declare K.
of K. (they now say Kitchener of Kaos) is a general colossal
failure. But the prevailing opinion is that his raising
of the new army has been good work but that he has failed
with the task of procuring munitions. As for Churchill,
he's too restless and erratic and dictatorial and fussy and
he runs about too much. I talked with him at dinner last
night at his mother's. He slips far down in his chair and
swears and be-dams and by-Gods his assertions. But his
energy does interest one. An impromptu meeting in the
Stock Exchange to-day voted confidence in K. of K. and
burned up a copy of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, which this morning
had a severe editorial about him.</p>

<p>Washington, having sent a severe note to Germany, is
now upbraided for not sending another to England, to
match and pair it. That's largely German influence, but
also the Chicago packers and the cotton men. These
latter have easy grievances, like the Irish. The delays of
the British Government are exasperating, but they are
really not so bad now as they have been. Still, the President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-416" id="page2-416"></a>[pg II-416]</span>
can be influenced by the criticism that he must
hit one side every time he hits the other, else he's not
neutral! I am working by every device to help the situation
and to prevent another note. I proposed to-day
to Sir Edward Grey that his Government make an immediate
advance payment on the cotton that it proposes
to buy.</p>

<p>Unless Joffre be a man of genius&mdash;of which there are
some indications&mdash;and unless French also possibly have
some claim to this distinction and <i>perhaps</i> the Grand
Duke Nikolas, there doesn't yet seem to be a great man
brought forth by the war. In civil life, Sir Edward Grey
comes to a high measure. As we yet see it from this
English corner of the world, no other statesman now ranks
with him.</p>


<p><i>March 20, 1916.</i></p>

<p>I am sure I have the best secret service that could be
got by any neutral. I am often amazed at its efficiency.
It is good because it is not a secret&mdash;certainly not a spy
service at all. It is all aboveboard and it is all done by
men of high honour and good character&mdash;I mean the
Embassy staff. Counting the attach&eacute;s there are about
twenty good men, every one of whom moves in a somewhat
different circle from any other one. Every one cultivates
his group of English folk, in and out of official life,
and his group in the diplomatic corps. There isn't a week
but every man of them sees his particular sources of
information&mdash;at their offices, at the Embassy, at luncheon,
at dinner, at the clubs&mdash;everywhere. We all take every
possible occasion to serve our friends and they serve us.
The result is, I verily believe, that we hear more than any
other group in London. These young fellows are all keen
as razors. They know when to be silent, too; and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-417" id="page2-417"></a>[pg II-417]</span>
are trusted as they deserve to be. Of course I see them,
singly or in pairs, every day in the regular conduct of the
work of the Embassy; and once a week we all meet together
and go over everything that properly comes before so
large a &quot;cabinet&quot; meeting. Thus some of us are on
confidential terms with somebody in every department
of the Government, with somebody in every other Embassy
and Legation, with all the newspapers and correspondents&mdash;even
with the censors. And the wives of those
that are married are abler than their husbands. They are
most attractive young women&mdash;welcome everywhere&mdash;and
indefatigable. Mrs. Page has them spend one afternoon
a week with her, rolling bandages; and that regular
meeting always yields something else. They come to my
house Thursday afternoons, too, when people always
drop in to tea-visitors from other countries, resident
Americans, English&mdash;everybody&mdash;Sometimes one hundred.</p>

<p>Nobody in this company is a &quot;Spy&quot;&mdash;God forbid! I
know no more honourable or attractive group of ladies and
gentlemen. Yet can conceive of no organization of spies
who could find out as many things. And the loyalty of
them all! Somebody now and then prefaces a revelation
with the declaration, &quot;This is in strict confidence&mdash;absolutely
nobody is to hear it.&quot; The answer is&mdash;&quot;Yes, only,
you know, I have no secrets from the Ambassador: no
member of his staff can ever have.&quot;&mdash;Of course, we get
some fun along with our tragedies. If I can find time, for
instance, I am going to write out for House's amusement
a verbatim report of every conversation that he held in
London. It has all come to me&mdash;from what he said to the
King down; and it all tallies with what House himself
told me. He went over it all himself to me the other day
at luncheon.&mdash;I not only believe&mdash;I am sure&mdash;that in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-418" id="page2-418"></a>[pg II-418]</span>
way I do get a correct judgment of public feeling and
public opinion, from Cabinet Ministers to stock-brokers.</p>


<p><i>December 11, 1916.</i></p>

<p>The new Government is quite as friendly to us in its
intentions as the old, and much more energetic. The old
Government was a spent force. Mr. Balfour is an agreeable
man to deal with, with a will to keep our sympathy,
unless the dire need of ships forces him to unpleasantness.
The Prime Minister is&mdash;American in his ways. Lord
Robert has the old Cecil in him, and he's going to maintain
the blockade at any cost that he can justify to himself
and to public opinion, and the public opinion is with him.
They are all eager to have American approval&mdash;much
more eager, I think, than a large section of public opinion,
which has almost ceased to care what Americans think
or do. The more we talk about peace, the more they
think about war. There is no vindictiveness in the
English. They do not care to do hurt to the German
people: they regard them as misguided and misled. But
no power on earth can stop the British till the German
military caste is broken&mdash;that leadership which attacked
Belgium and France and would destroy England. Balfour,
Lloyd George, the people, the army and the navy
are at one in this matter, every labouring man, everybody,
except a little handful of Quakers and professors and Noel
Buxton. I think I know and see all the peace men. They
feel that they can talk to me with safety. They send me
their pamphlets and documents. I think that all of them
have now become warlike but three, and one of them is a
woman. If you meet a woman you know on the street
and express a sympathy on the loss of her second son, she
will say to you, &quot;Yes, he died in defence of his country.
My third son will go next week. They all die to save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-419" id="page2-419"></a>[pg II-419]</span>
us.&quot; Doubtless she sheds tears in private. But her eyes
are dry in public. She has discarded her luxuries to put
money in the war loan. Say &quot;Peace&quot; to her? She would
insult you.</p>


<p><i>May 10, 1917.</i></p>

<p>We dined at Lambeth Palace. There was Lord Morley,
whom I had not seen since his long illness&mdash;much reduced
in flesh, and quite feeble and old-looking. But his mind
and speech were most alert. He spoke of Cobden favouring
the Confederate States because the constitution of the
Confederacy provided for free trade. But one day Bright
informed Cobden that he was making the mistake of his
life. Thereafter Cobden came over to the Union side.
This, Morley heard direct from Bright.</p>

<p>The Archbishop spoke in high praise of Charnwood's
Lincoln&mdash;was surprised at its excellence, etc.
Geoffrey Robinson<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82" /><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> asked who wrote the <i>Quarterly</i>
articles in favour of the Confederacy all through the war&mdash;was
it Lord Salisbury? Nobody knew.</p>

<p>The widow of the former Archbishop Benson was there&mdash;the
mother of all the Bensons, Hugh, A.C., etc., etc.&mdash;a
remarkable old lady, who talked much in admiration of
Balfour.</p>

<p>The Bishop of&mdash;Winchester(?)&mdash;was curious to know
whether the people in the United States really understood
the Irish question&mdash;the two-nation, two-religion aspect
of the case. I had to say no!</p>

<p>There is an orphan asylum founded by some preceding
Archbishop, by the sea. The danger of bombardment
raised the question of safety. The Archbishop ordered
all the children (40) to be sent to Lambeth Palace. We
dined in a small dining room: &quot;The children,&quot; Mrs. Davidson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-420" id="page2-420"></a>[pg II-420]</span>
explained, &quot;have the big dining room.&quot; Each child
has a lady as patroness or protector who &quot;adopts&quot; her,
i.e., sees that she is looked after, etc. Some of the ladies
who now do this were themselves orphans!</p>

<p>At prayers as usual at 10 o'clock in the chapel where
prayers have been held every night&mdash;for how many centuries?</p>

<p>At lunch to-day at Mr. Asquith's&mdash;Lord Lansdowne
there; took much interest in the Knapp farm work while
I briefly explained.</p>

<p>Lord Morley said to Mrs. Page he had become almost a
Tolstoyan&mdash;Human progress hasn't done much for mankind's
happiness, etc. Look at the war&mdash;by a &quot;progressive&quot;
nation. Now the mistake here is horn of a class-society,
a society that rests on privilege. &quot;Progress,&quot;
has done everything (1) in liberating men's minds and
spirits in the United States. This is the real gain; (2)
in arraying all the world <i>against</i> Germany.</p>


<p><i>Tuesday, January 22, 1918.</i></p>

<p>Some days bring a bunch of interesting things or men.
Then there sometimes come relatively dull days&mdash;not
often, however. To-day came:</p>

<p>General Tasker H. Bliss, Chief-of-Staff, now 64&mdash;the
wisest (so I judge) of our military men, a rather wonderful
old chap. He's on his way to Paris as a member of the
Supreme War Council at Versailles. The big question
he has struck is: Shall American troops be put into the
British and French lines, in small groups, to fill up the
gaps in those armies? The British have persuaded him
that it is a military necessity. If it were less than a
necessity, it would, of course, be wrong&mdash;i.e., it would cut
across our national pride, force our men under another
flag, etc. It is not proposed to deprive Pershing of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-421" id="page2-421"></a>[pg II-421]</span>
command nor even of his army. The plan is to bring over
troops that would not otherwise now come and to lend
these to the British and French armies, and to let Pershing
go on with his army as if this hadn't been done. Bliss is
inclined to grant this request on condition the British
bring these men over, equip and feed them, etc. He
came in to ask me to send a telegram for him to-morrow
to the President, making this recommendation. But on
reflection he decided to wait till he had seen and heard the
French also, who desire the same thing as the British.</p>

<p>General Bliss is staying with Major Warburton; and
Warburton gave me some interesting glimpses of him.
A telegram came for the General. Warburton thought
that he was out of the house and he decided to take it
himself to the General's room. He opened the door.
There sat the General by the fire talking to himself,
wrapped in thought. Warburton walked to the middle
of the room. The old man didn't see him. He decided
not to disturb him, for he was rehearsing what he proposed
to say to the Secretary of State for War or to the Prime
Minister&mdash;getting his ears as well as his mind used to
it. Warburton put the telegram on the table near the
General, went out, and wasn't discovered.</p>

<p>Several nights, he sat by the fire with Warburton and
began to talk, again rehearsing to himself some important
conclusions that he had reached. Every once in a while
he'd look up at Warburton and say: &quot;Now, what do you
think of that?&quot;</p>

<p>That's an amazing good way to get your thought clear
and your plans well laid out. I've done it myself.</p>

<p>I went home and Kipling and Carrie<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83" /><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> were at lunch with
us. Kipling said: &quot;I'll tell you, your coming into the war
made a new earth for me.&quot; He is on a committee to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2-422" id="page2-422"></a>[pg II-422]</span>
that British graves are properly marked and he talked
much about it. I could not help thinking that in the back
of his mind there was all the time thought of his own dead
boy, John.</p>

<p>Then in the afternoon Major Drain brought the copy of
a contract between the United States Government and
the British to build together 1500 tanks ($7,500,000).
We took it to the Foreign Office and Mr. Balfour and I
signed it. Drain thinks that the tanks are capable of
much development and he wishes our army after the war
to keep on studying and experimenting with and improving
such machines of destruction. Nobody knows what
may come of it.</p>

<p>Then I dined at W.W. Astor's (Jr.) There were Balfour,
Lord Salisbury, General and Lady Robertson, Mrs.
Lyttleton and Philip Kerr.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Captain Amundsen, Arctic explorer
came in, on his way from Norway to France as the
guest of our Government, whereafter he will go to the
United States and talk to Scandinavian people there.</p>

<p>That's a pretty good kind of a full day.</p>


<p><i>April, 19, 1918.</i></p>

<p>Bell<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84" /><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, and Mrs. Bell during the air raid took their little
girl (Evangeline, aged three) to the cellar. They told
her they went to the cellar to hear the big fire crackers.
After a bomb fell that shook all Chelsea, Evangeline
clapped her hands in glee. &quot;Oh, mummy, what a <i>big</i>
fire cracker!&quot;</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
